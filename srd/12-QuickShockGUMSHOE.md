# QuickShock GUMSHOE

*QuickShock GUMSHOE features a faster, entirely player-facing combat system. It keeps Composure/Stability and Health as general abilities, but rather than functioning as hit points, they give the players opportunities to resist taking Injury and Shock cards. These exert ongoing effects, and take the character out of play if they get too many of them at once.*

## *Getting Clues*

*As per standard GUMSHOE; see above.*

*The one change to investigative ability use in QuickShock is that spends to gain special benefits are replaced with Pushes:*

## Pushes

Characters can spend Pushes to gain benefits tied to their Investigative abilities. They never have to spend Pushes to get information, especially not information vital to moving forward through the story to solve its main mystery.

For example, you could spend an Art History Push to:

  - acquire a painting you covet at a bargain price

  - establish a friendly prior relationship with a famous artist appearing in the current scenario

  - deflate a bullying sculptor by exposing the technical flaws in his work

  - impress a snob with your fine taste, winning her confidence

You never use Pushes on General abilities.

Some Shock and Injury cards can be discarded by spending a Push.

On occasion the GM may allow players to gain benefits not connected to any ability in the game, in exchange for a Push. For example, a player might ask if a flammable haystack happens to be situated conveniently close to a farmhouse she wants to burn down. That isn’t under the character’s control in any way, but for the cost of a Push can be put within the player’s.

Pushes replace investigative spends as you may know them from standard GUMSHOE. You no longer allocate separate pool points to your various Investigative abilities.

## Tests

*\[Tests of general abilities are the same as given earlier in this document, with the following adjustments\]*

### When Your Rating is 0

You can always test any ability, even when you didn’t acquire any points in it during character generation.

When it breaks story credibility for you to show even rudimentary competence in an ability, your GM may ask you to justify how you could do whatever it is you are doing. When in doubt, suggest that a PC who does have the ability gave you pointers, either directly or through observation.

**Unrule***:* This departs from the standard GUMSHOE, which forbids tests of abilities you have not invested in. QuickShock GUMSHOE demands more tests from the players than the baseline game; this more generous interpretation saves us from adding, and you from having to remember and implement, a bunch of special case rules.

### Salience

The GM never calls for tests that don’t advance the story. Some Injury and Shock cards allow you to discard the card, or gain some other benefit, on a successful test. These assume a test relevant to the storyline. Benefits are not available if the player initiates a test unrelated to the current action in a clearly gratuitous attempt to trigger them.

## Time Increments

Certain GUMSHOE rules refer to various increments of time.

### Intervals

A new interval begins each time the group acquires a new core clue. When more than one core clue can be gained during a single scene, only the first clue counts as starting a new interval. When a rule says, for example, that something happens after two intervals pass, it means that the group must gather two core clues in separate scenes.

### Sessions

A session is the time spent playing one sitting of the game, whatever that happens to be.

If your sessions wildly differ from a baseline of three to four hours, you may find yourself adjusting the timing of effects keyed to sessions.

### Scenarios

An effect that lasts until the end of a scenario concludes when the main answer to a mystery occurs, plus a perhaps a brief coda in which the team ties up loose ends, breaks terrible news to grieving relatives, make patrons aware of debts incurred or discharged, and so on.

Depending on how quickly the players crack the case at hand, a scenario might encompass multiple sessions, or last for one session only.

I try to time my scenarios to coincide with the ends of sessions, but sometimes the pacing gods mess with that desire, requiring me to start a new scenario in the middle of a session.

### World Time

An hour, you will be shocked to learn, means an hour’s worth of time.

But wait\!

An hour of **world time** refers to time as it unfolds for the *characters*. As in a piece of fiction, world time almost never elapses at the same rate for the characters as for the players and GM. A day might pass in a single sentence from the GM: “A day later, you find yourself at the inn.” Or you could spend minutes describing an action that in world time takes only a second or two.

### Game Time

An hour of **game time** refers to the real-world time you, *the GM and players*, spend at the gaming table (or lounging around in chairs in the den or whatever).

The distinction between world and game time mostly matters when measuring the duration of Shock and Injury cards.

## Refreshing Points and Pushes

When points or pushes return to their starting values, we call that a **refresh**.

Pushes refresh to 2 per player at the start of each session.

General ability pools return to the value of their ratings at the start of each scenario.

This assumes a scenario that takes one or two sessions to complete.

GMs may wish to build moments into longer scenarios, or ones in which significant leaps of time occur, which allow General ability points to refresh.

When a rule, card text, or scenario refers simply to a refresh, read that to mean a full refresh—the character’s pool returns to its full value.

### Partial Refreshes

In some cases partial refreshes occur, in which the character regains a set number of points. These are marked with the number of points regained: so in a 2-point refresh, characters can top up their pools by 2 points.

Partial refreshes never allow characters to increase their pools above their ratings.

## Fighting

1.  Though the characters spend most of their time solving mysteries, sometimes the answers they seek lead them into violent conflict. Fight scenes in *YKRPG* unfold in the following stages.

### Define Objectives

2.  Define the objective of each side.
    
    The GM chooses for the opposition.
    
    Players confer to choose their collective objective. If they fail to agree, and any player chooses kill, that’s the objective.
    
    Common objectives are:
    
    **Kill**: Keep fighting until everyone on the other side of the fight is dead.
    
    **Render Helpless**: Keep fighting until everyone on the other side of the fight is too hurt to continue. Helpless opponents remain on the scene. You may take them prisoner or depart as they roll around on the ground in pain. Killing helpless people, or intelligent creatures, generally requires Composure tests (baseline Difficulty of 6) to avoid Shock. **Minor**: A Crossed Line; **Major**: Out of Control.
    
    **Gain Surrender:** Keep fighting until everyone on the other side agrees to be taken into custody, in exchange for a promise of fair treatment. Not all combatants will willingly surrender. When they don’t, the GM treats the situation as if the players have chosen the Render Helpless objective.
    
    **Beat Up**: Thrash your opponents and walk away, leaving them badly hurt but not dead.
    
    **Block**: Stop your opponents from moving past you.
    
    **Drive Away**: Keep fighting until everyone on the other side retreats. If they were attacking you, they flee back to wherever they came from. If they were defending a position, they flee in random directions or back toward the nearest position of safety. Use when you want to defeat your enemy without killing or capturing them.
    
    **Escape**: Flee to a position of safety the enemy is not attempting to hold or protect.
    
    **Escape with a Captive**: Grab a member of the opposing force, then flee with your new captive to a position of safety the enemy is not attempting to hold or protect. Where the enemy group includes combatants of varied ability, you take its weakest or most vulnerable member.
    
    **Gain an Item**: Grab a portable, easily seized item held by a member of the opposing force, then flee with it to a position of safety the enemy is not attempting to hold or protect. Suitable items include books, weapons, amulets, purses, satchels, and documents.
    
    **Overrun**: You forcibly move through a group of opponents attempting to block you from going somewhere.
    
    **Topple**: You knock the target off its feet—which is only worth doing when your enemy stands on a cliffside, on the brink of a raging river, in a precarious rowboat, or in some like situation where a fall will cause a more-than-momentary setback.

### Determine Difficulty

17. The GM (or scenario) defines a Difficulty reflecting the overall strength of the entire opposition, including any tactical advantages or disadvantages they may have in this particular situation. Difficulties for foes described in this book come with assigned Difficulties, but you can always bounce them up and down to fit the logic of your story. Describe situational modifiers to make shifts feel consistent to players.

### Opt-Out Penalties

18. Foe Difficulties assume that the foe has to fight an entire party of PCs. When player characters elect to skip a fight, those who do take part in the battle suffer a -1 Fighting penalty per absent PC. The foe’s Toll increases by 1 for each absent PC.
    
    For further explanation of, and exceptions to, this rule, see “Fighting at Less Than Full Strength,” p. XX.

### Tolls

63. The other key game statistic for a foe, listed above, is its Toll.
    
    Even a protagonist who wins a fight sometimes gets banged up along the way. Tolls represent the negligible bumps, scrapes, jars, and jolts investigators sustain as they dish out worse to their enemies.
    
    Players pay Tolls from any combination of Athletics, Fighting, and Health. Characters who can’t or won’t pay the Toll instead take foe’s Minor Injury card.
    
    As you can see from the above table, only the more formidable foes, who will knock you around a bit before you put them down, impose Tolls.
    
    In standard GUMSHOE, the equivalent of a Toll is a Health point loss that leaves you above 0 Health.
    
    You might also compare them to the small hit point losses common to other roleplaying games, like *D\&D* and *13th Age*.

### Fight Tracker

69. To aid you in running the fight, ready a copy of the handy blank table we call the Fight Tracker. A page of Fight Trackers appears in this book’s Appendix, p. XX. Or find one formatted for your standard printer paper size at Pelgrane’s Yellow King resource page, which you can locate from pelgranepress.com.

### Declare Spends

136. Ask each player in turn how many Fighting points they’re spending on the coming test. Enter this number in the “Spend” row.
     
     Noelle, Gianni, and Tsing all say they’re spending 3 points.
     
     Carrie tells you she’s spending 4. Saif goes for 2. Ana only has 1 to spend.

### Determine Order of Action

172. Players are about to take turns, in the following order:
     
     High spends go first. Players spending 0 points go last.
     
     When two or more players are making the same spend, the ones seated on the left (from your point of view) go before those seated on the right.
     
     Carrie is spending more than anyone, at 4 points. She goes first.
     
     Then come the players spending 3, from left to right: Noelle, Gianni, and Tsing.

     In an online game without an apparent seating order, break ties in the order of action in whatever manner you find most intuitive. Alphabetical by player or character name probably works best. Does the platform you’re using create a virtual seating order? Use that.
     
     <span class="smallcaps">Alternate Rule</span>: Some groups prefer to reverse the order of action, going from lowest to highest spends. This choice values narrative clarity over suspense. It allows players of the characters delivering what are likely to be the finishing blows to describe the definitive actions they take to beat the foe. If they win, that is.

### Players Take Their Turns

183. Players take individual turns, in which they:
     
     Describe what they’re hoping to physically accomplish in the fight.
     
     Make Fighting tests.
     
     Compare Fighting test results against the foe’s Difficulty number, including applicable modifiers
     
     1.  Players who meet or beat the number:
         
         1.  Describe themselves successfully doing what they set out to do in step 1.
             
             Must either pay the foe’s Toll (if any) or take its Minor Injury card. (A few foes instead deal out Shocks.) The Toll, listed in the foe’s profile, can be paid from any combination of Fighting, Athletics, or Health. If they take the Injury, you narrate how they suffer it, based on the card’s title and text.
         
         If they do not meet or beat the number:
         
         1.  You describe their chosen opponent defeating their attempt.
             
             On a margin of 0 or 1, they take the foe’s Minor Injury card.
             
             On a higher margin, they take the foe’s Major Injury card.
     
     You mark the player’s margin, which may be positive, negative, or zero, under their column in the margin row of the fight tracker. If the margin exceeds 3, it truncates, becoming a 3. Players whose margins are truncated get a special reward at the end, so mark this by underlining any truncated margin.
     
     If other players have already acted, add the player’s margin to the running combined total of all previous margins. Cross out the margin for the last player who acted. Call out the new running margin to the players.
     
     1.  If it is positive or zero, describe how they are collectively triumphing over their adversaries. Zero indicates that they’re winning by the slimmest of hairs.
         
         If it is negative, describe their enemies taking the upper hand in the fight.
         
         As necessary, throw in bits of narration to keep the sense of threat alive.
     
     If other players have yet to take their turn, return to step 1 with the next player in the order of action.
     
     If this player was the last in the turn order, move to the next stage, “Name the Victors,” below.

     As previously determined, Carrie goes first. “Odile rushes in and tries to distract them by waving her parasol about, as if unhinged.”
     
     “Do you use the sword cane part of the parasol?” you ask, knowing Odile’s ways.
     
     “No, we don’t want to hurt them.”
     
     Carrie has chosen to spend 4 and rolls a 3, for an outcome of 7. Given the Difficulty of 4, that succeeds, with a margin of 3. The watchmen, as relatively underpowered opponents, have Tolls of 0. Carrie avoids a Minor Injury without having to pay additional points from her Athletics, Fighting, or Health pools.
     
     You tell Carrie that she succeeds, so she narrates the result: “Taken aback by my bizarre capering, they press themselves up against the alley walls, leaving the die on the ground.”
     
     You note her positive margin on the Fight Tracker:

     Next comes Noelle: “I rush up and stoop down to scoop up the die.”
     
     Having spent 3, she rolls a 1. She succeeds, but with a margin of 0. Still, that means she can pay the watchmen’s Toll of 0 to avoid Injury, which she does.
     
     “You succeed,” you say, “but by the skin of your teeth.”

     The scuffle so far has become a mite static, so you throw in a bit of narration that keeps the suspense going without depicting the heroes as suddenly losing: “The other watchmen unfreeze and come barreling toward the lot of you.”
     
     Now Tsing goes: “Jack redeems himself by putting his sculptor’s muscles to use dishing out the honest punches of a stout-hearted Yankee\!”
     
     He spent 3 and rolls a 5, for a result of 8. Like the others he pays a Toll of 0 to avoid Minor Injury. His margin is 4, but that truncates to the maximum single margin of 3 when you note it on the tracker. You underline it to note that it has been truncated.

     If it meets or beats 0, the group scores a victory and achieves its declared goal. Invite players with margins higher than 0 to describe the actions they perform to definitively achieve it. Go from highest to lowest margin, breaking ties from low to high spend, then seating order.
     
     Did everyone get a 0? Then everyone narrates.
     
     @@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@
     
     Carrie, Tsing, and Saif have margins higher than 0, so you invite them to narrate. Carrie has the same margin but a higher spend, so she goes last. Tsing and Saif both have the same spend and margin, so follow her in seating order.
     
     “I grab the bouncing die and put it safely in my pocket\!” Carrie cries.
     
     “I complete the remaining thrashings,” Tsing narrates.
     
     “And I get in a few kicks as I guide the rest of my friends to a safe helter-skelter dash through Montparnasse\!” adds Saif.
     
     If not, the GM describes how the opposition thwarts them as they suffer a defeat. Their enemies can’t hurt them any further, but they can put them in an otherwise worse situation. Of course, the character who took a third Injury card has been killed by that last Injury.

     Characters scoring a margin greater than 3 get a Fight Benefit. They may either:

  - gain a Push

  - refresh a General ability other than Fighting, Health, or Athletics

<!-- end list -->

     Checking the Fight Tracker, you see that Saif’s margin is underlined, meaning that you truncated it to 3. He chooses to refresh Sense Trouble.

     \[\[END BOX\]\]

### Fighting as Quick Test

459. On occasion you might rule that a character can achieve an objective by scoring a Fighting success outside of the combat system. The PC might be, for example:
     
     restraining or knocking out a physically unprepossessing person
     
     wrenching a pistol from someone intent on self-harm
     
     hunting a game animal
     
     1.  Treat this as you would any other General test.

## Shocks and Injuries

When characters are physically harmed or undergo mental shocks, they gain cards reflecting the harm they suffer.

Depending on what you all find convenient, your GM may choose to give you:

  - physical cards, in the form of slips of paper printed out from PDF and handed to you

  - virtual cards; check pelgranepress.com for our most up-to-date tools for digital card dealing

Whatever the form factor, the game uses the language of playing cards to describe how you handle them. When you gain an Injury or Shock, you add it to your hand. When you get rid of it, you discard it. You sometimes trade one card for another—most often a really bad shock or injury for a less bad one.

Text on the cards is exceptions-based, meaning that when the card text contradicts another game rule, it takes precedence over the general rules.

Discard all cards at the end of each scenario, with the exception of cards marked **Continuity**. Any card without this tag, and without an explicit discard condition, is discarded at the end of a scenario.

Most cards tell you what you have to do to get rid of them during a session. They may simply indicate that you have to pay a price or overcome an obstacle, leaving the details of that up to you to weave into the story, and the GM to approve. If it feels like something that would credibly get rid of the problem in a story or TV show, the GM approves it.

When an Injury card lists a First Aid Difficulty, another character with that ability can get rid of the card for you by successfully making that test.

Some cards allow you to fulfill conditions, like spending General points or Pushes, to discard the card. In certain cases you can do this only after a specified time has elapsed. Where no time is specified, you can get rid of the card immediately, suffering no ill effect other than the expenditure.

Some cards refer to abilities that appear in only some of the game’s sequences. In such cases the *Use In*: notation appears below the card text, followed by abbreviations specifying the sequences the card can be used in. P for *Paris*, W for *The Wars*, A for *Aftermath*, and N for *This Is Normal Now*. (The core books don’t include any cards specific to the first or last sequences, but maybe we’ll think of some and publish them in later books.)

You may be tempted to make cards gained during the final scene of a scenario Continuity cards, on the grounds that their cool effects will otherwise never come into play. Though that makes some sense on a theoretical level, in practice you’ll find this option too punitive. It can put characters in a death spiral right from the start of a new mystery. Instead, accept that cards given out in what turns out to be a concluding scene only matter if they become Final cards.

### Death and Incapacity

A character dies and leaves play for good after receiving too many Injury cards.

A character suffers irreparable mental strain and leaves play (played by the GM if the character appears again at all) after receiving too many Shock cards.

In **\[\[Tough\]\]** mode, too many = 3. The third card in either category you take is called your Final card.

In **\[\[Forgiving\]\]** mode, too many = 4. The fourth card in either category you take is called your Final card.

On a Final Injury card, the GM invites you to describe a suitable death, given the circumstances that led to your gaining that fatal third card. You might:

  - take inspiration from the situation currently being narrated

<!-- end list -->

  - describe an even worse version of the harm implied by the title and effects of the Final card

  - describe a fatal worsening of a condition suggested by a previous Injury card already in hand

Likewise, as soon as you have three Shock cards in hand, your character loses all grip on reality.

You might:

  - take inspiration from the situation currently being narrated

<!-- end list -->

  - describe an even worse version of the emotional or perceptual break implied by the title and effects of the Final card

  - describe a condition suggested by a previous Shock card already in hand shattering the character’s psyche

This could be followed up with a suggestion of the character’s eventual fate: commitment to a sanitarium, becoming a shut-in kept in the family attic back in Westchester, loping off into the woods to live as a hermit, or the like. Depending on where the characters are when you take the Final card, you might describe this right away, or after an appropriate break in the action. In some instances the GM may wish to reserve the right to treat the now-unbalanced character as an antagonist, ongoing or otherwise.

After the narration ensuing from a Final card, the player creates a new character, using the guidelines on p. XX.

If you hear a player conclude that their characters only have three (or four) hit points, they’re setting themselves up for confusion and annoyance, as that’s not how this rules set thinks. Head off that conceptual stumbling block by providing the explanation on p. XX.

**Unrule**: Unlike standard GUMSHOE, your Composure and Health pools never directly determine whether you remain in play. You never drop below 0 in those pools.

### Card Terms

As a shorthand certain cards use standard terms, defined here.

**+x to Tolls**: The character holding the card treats foes as if their Tolls are a specified number of points higher. Tolls for characters not holding such cards do not increase.

**Discard**: Unless otherwise specified, the instruction “discard” applies to the card the text appears on.

**GMC**: A character run by the Game Moderator.

**A night’s sleep:** The character must gain a solid night’s sleep in circumstances not much less safe and comfortable than she would be used to during her ordinary, non-mystery investigating life. (Requiring a good night’s sleep from the player, as opposed to the character, would be weird even for this game.)

**Nonlethal:** Cannot be your Final card. If received when you are one short of the Final card in its category, you take the card and undergo its effects, if any, but your character does not leave play.

You have 2 Injury cards in hand, in a game played in \[\[Tough\]\] mode. You receive the Tipsy Injury card, which is Nonlethal. Your character does not die.

However, a nonlethal card **does** count toward you total when you have it in hand already and another incoming card becomes your Final card.

Later, after discarding one of your other Injury cards, you have 2 remaining: Breaking Point and Tipsy. You then get a third card, Ravaged by the Elements. In this instance Tipsy does count toward your total, and your character dies. You shouldn’t have gone out into that blizzard half-tanked on brandy\!

**Pay a price**: When you suffer a significant negative consequence to bring about a situation that allows you to discard a card. GM decides what “significant” means.

**Recipient**: When one character performs a test or spends to benefit another, the character receiving the benefit is the recipient. When a card says you must be the recipient of a success or spend to discard a card, your character may not perform the action; any other PC can.

**Take a risk**: You perform an action that stands a decent chance of getting you into real trouble, as judged by the GM.

When card text tells you that you lose a number of points, your pool drops by that number. If you have fewer pool points than the card specifies, your pool drops to 0.

You might receive a card that costs you a number of points you don’t have and therefore can't pay. In that case, count yourself lucky: you’re off the hook\! The GM does not swap your card for a different one to ensure that you suffer some other disadvantage. Having a Shock or Injury card is bad news all by itself, even if you can shrug off its specific ill effect.

## Combat Special Cases, Exceptions, and Explanations

To make the basic combat rules easier to learn and refer to, we saved a subsection for the following entries.

### Fighting at Less than Full Strength

The Relative Challenge of foes is calculated assuming that they’re taking on a full group of PCs.

Weaker members of a group may be tempted to sit out a battle and let those with higher Fighting pools take all the risk.

This is not a smart move: it gives the enemy a numbers advantage.

Even a single foe capable of taking on many heroes will have an easier time against three investigators than it would against four, and easier still against only two adversaries.

This is how fights work in any roleplaying game: a dragon has an easier time against a fighter and a cleric than she would against a fighter, a cleric, a wizard, and a rogue.

When player characters elect to skip a fight, those who do take part in the battle receive a -1 Fighting penalty per absent comrade. The foe’s Toll increases by 1 for each absent PC. This reflects the added challenge and costs of fighting while short-handed.

GMs may choose to ignore the penalty for fighting at less than full strength when it seems punitive or contrary to story logic. Apt times to waive the penalty include:

  - When the party is at less than full strength due to circumstances contrived by the GM. If the group splits up and half of them get in a tussle with drunken rival students, or attacked by yeth-hounds, describe only enough adversaries to threaten half the group, and ignore the penalty. (In group vs. group melees, the number of foes you describe is a matter of atmosphere and description. It can be higher or greater than the size of the PC group without impacting the game mechanics.)

  - When players (as opposed to their characters) are absent.

  - When a character is not just unwilling but unable to fight due to the effects of a completely debilitating Shock or Injury card.

The GM need never waive the penalty when players bend the story out of shape to justify fighting at less than full strength.

When you waive the penalty, and another fight against the same enemy occurs later, you may need to describe countervailing changes in the situation to explain why she seems just as effective against a larger force of PCs. More likely, with die results and spends adding variance to the outcome, no one will notice or care.

(In bookkeeping terms, it’s simpler to increase the foe’s Difficulty number by the number of missing combatants than to ask players to calculate penalties. A few players find this confusing on a conceptual level, though. It feels to them that it’s the foes who are becoming more or less powerful, as opposed to the PCs’ force becoming relatively weaker as its numbers diminish. If your players don’t have a problem with it, use this simpler option instead.)

### Support Actions

When players ask if they can do things in combat other than make Fighting tests, answer by revealing these rules. This delayed introduction simplifies the combat system’s learning curve. Support actions give players more choices, at the cost of additional complexity and rules consultation.

Characters can elect to take a **support action**, contributing to others’ success in combat instead of taking on the enemy directly.

Players taking support actions can hold their actions, inserting themselves into the Fighting order when their help appears to be needed. They test the ability they’re substituting for Fighting against the foe’s Difficulty.

**On a failure**, the character taking the support action:

  - takes a Minor Injury (if margin is 0 or 1) or a Major Injury (if margin is 2 or more)

  - pays the foe’s Toll

  - subtracts the margin from the group’s combat total

**On a success**, the character gains the benefit corresponding to the chosen type of support action:

  - **First Aid**: When any one other character is assigned an Injury card, you may choose for it to be discarded before it is received (in the case of a Minor Injury card) or (in the case of a Major Injury) downgraded to a Minor Injury.

  - **Athletics**: Draw fire to yourself and away from a comrade. When another character is assigned an Injury card, you may choose to take that card instead. Restricted to one beneficiary per combat.

  - **Composure** (if the goal is Gain Surrender): Grant a bonus to any one comrade’s Fighting test. +1 if your margin is 1 or less; +2 if your margin is 2 or more. As with any bonus, this applies before the test is made.

  - **Morale**: When any one other character is assigned a Shock card, cause it to be discarded before it is received (in the case of a Minor Shock card) or (in the case of a Major Shock) downgraded to a Minor Shock. (*Applies only to foes that dish out Shock cards in combat instead of Injury cards. The Morale ability appears in* The Wars *and* Aftermath.)

  - **Traps and Bombs**/**Insurgency**: Soften up the foe with a grenade or other small explosive device. Allows one character of your choice making a Fighting test to roll two dice, picking the best one and ignoring the other. If you fail your test, you do not take an Injury card. Instead, your exploding device hurts someone on your own side. Choose another PC taking part in the fight to receive an Injury—Light Shrapnel if your margin is 1 or less; Shrapnel if the margin is 2 or more. (*Traps and Bombs appears in* The Wars, as do the Light Shrapnel and Shrapnel cards; *Insurgency appears in* Aftermath.)

  - **Artillery**: Hem in the foe with a heavy arms barrage; requires access to such a weapon. Make this test before any other support actions or Fighting tests. Foe Difficulty decreases by 1 if your margin was 1 or less, by 2 if your margin was 2 or more. If you fail your test, you do not take an Injury card. Instead, Tolls paid by other characters increase by your margin + 1, and any other characters taking Minor Injuries instead take the Major Injury card Shrapnel.

The GM may allow support actions using abilities not listed above, if they make sense in the current situation. Apply one of the above-listed benefits of success, using the +1 or +2 bonus to another’s Fighting test as default.

A Mechanics test might apply when the objective is Escape or Escape with a Captive, if there’s a vehicle in need of repairing or hotwiring.

Characters taking support actions count as present for the fight. They do not trigger penalties for fighting at less than full strength.

### Reinforcements

When they want to solve a problem by fighting a challenging opponent, player characters often look for other people to suffer and die in their place.

This rarely works for characters in horror stories—or in more heroic genres, for that matter. Expect it to be just as hard to pull off in *The Yellow King Roleplaying Game*.

When the GM does reckon that your attempt to recruit cannon fodder makes sense within the story, those additional fighters don’t count as full combatants the way player characters do.

Instead, the GM reduces the Difficulty of your Fighting tests, reflecting the assistance of reinforcements.

Or she may decide that the presence of reinforcements discourages your enemies, preventing a fight altogether.

### Imagining Combat

*YKRPG* combat differs from what your players might be used to in standard GUMSHOE, and from other roleplaying games. Help your players adjust to this more abstract approach with the following As to likely Qs.

***What are the limits on what I can describe when narrating my character’s Fighting success?***

If you succeeded, have fun inventing imaginative and vivid visual descriptions of your contribution to the fight. You could calibrate your description to your margin, with 0 or 1 representing a small contribution; 2, something impressive but just short of decisive; and 3, an over-the-top example of thrilling triumph. Or just say what comes to mind and fits your character and the situation. Other than that, feel free to use maximum creative license. In the very unlikely event that your description contradicts a fact about the mystery or world that the GM understands as crucial to the rest of the story, she’ll suggest an amended version of your proposed narration that preserves that essential plot point.

***Why do we have to act in descending spend order?***

This introduces suspense, keeping open the question of whether the group will succeed to the maximum extent possible. We know the high-spenders are likely to succeed, but what about those relying mostly on the luck of the die?

***What if we go in ascending spend order?***

This makes no mechanical difference, so if that makes better sense to your group, you can change that up without unpleasant surprises.

***What happens when investigators join a fight in waves?***

The GM alters the order of action so that you make Fighting tests in the order in which you join the fight. Assuming you had no time to collectively decide on a group goal beforehand, late joiners have to go along with the goal chosen by the first character(s) to enter the fight.

***Can we switch our goal if the situation changes in mid-fight?***

This will happen less often than you might think, but sure. If the entire group agrees, you can switch to a new goal when you describe your final victory, provided it carries an equal or less costly Difficulty number than the originally chosen goal.

***We spend too much time deciding on our group goal.***

That’s less a question than a statement, but we’ll allow it. If this remains an issue for your group, expect your GM to remedy it by suggesting the most obvious choice and guiding the discussion to a quick resolution.

***We don’t want to pick a goal; we want our characters charge in at cross-purposes and describe what our characters are doing tactically. Strategy is for suckers, man\!***

Groups devoted to this style of play will have a better experience by reverting from QuickShock to standard GUMSHOE. Notes on how to do this may be available on the Pelgrane website by the time you read this.

***I have 2 Injury cards, both describing pretty minor conditions. How can that put my character on the brink of death?***

You’re not on the brink of death at all. You’re ever so slightly off your game—in a way that might tip the balance between survival and funeral arrangements the next time you face a dangerous situation. Think of the last time you had a really bad cold or flu, or when you last pulled a back muscle or hurt yourself in some other painful but minor way. Then imagine yourself in that state when you need to steer your car clear of a pile-up or jump out of the way of a collapsing store display. That extra drag on your awareness and ability to react is what your cards in hand represent—nothing if you stay out of trouble, but potentially disastrous if you don’t.

Also remember that when you receive a Final Injury card, you describe a demise that best fits the situation, whether it matches the card concept or not.

Players steeped in classic roleplaying games like *D\&D* and *Call of Cthulhu* may want to describe QuickShock GUMSHOE characters as having three hit points apiece. This conceptualization will confuse more than it clarifies, so shoot it down if someone brings it up. Injuries are status effects. You’re not one-third or one-quarter dead on a single Injury, two-thirds or half dead on another, and then dead.

Think of it as “off your game,” “vulnerable,” and then dead (**\[\[Tough\]\] mode**) or “off your game,” “vulnerable,” “really shouldn’t be fighting now,” and dead (**\[\[Forgiving\]\] mode**).

Tolls are the closest thing QuickShock GUMSHOE has to hit points, but even there the analogy doesn’t entirely track.

***What does the GM do if the foe’s goal is something other than kill, and its Injury card seems out of place for that less aggressive objective?***

In most cases the foe still has to rough you up somewhat to get what it wants. The GM may choose to substitute other Injuries more fitting to the circumstances. In a pinch, the minor/major pairing of “You Should See the Other Fellow” and “Concussed” fit most non-lethal foe objectives.

## When Player Characters Fight

We’re tucking these rules here in our final appendix, as you’ll need them rarely if ever. Ordinarily a physical struggle between members of the main cast tells you that the story has gone seriously sideways.

Still, in horror stories the protagonists now and then have to square off against each other. They might get possessed, suffer perceptual delusions, or be forced to do battle in a death-trap filled basement.

When threat of PC vs. PC violence sparks from a player choice, warn the one escalating to fratricidal violence that the system favors the sympathetic defender over the murderous aggressor—as stories tend to do when protagonists come to blows.

### Aggressor and Defender

Based on the events narrated by the group so far, the GM identifies which characters are the aggressors and which the defenders.

This becomes obvious in context: the character or group of characters who escalate from talking to fighting are the aggressors. Those being attacked are the defenders.

In the oddball case when both seem to start the fight at the same moment, choose the side with the player most responsible for steering the story to this point. If that doesn’t make sense either, ask an involved player to roll a die. On an even roll, treat that player’s side as defenders. On an odd result, they’re the attackers.

Usually fights have one aggressor and one defender. Scraps featuring multiple player characters on one or both sides happen less often. It is conceivable that supporting characters may take part on one or both sides as well, though their effect on the outcome is indirect.

### Define Objectives

The aggressor(s) starts by defining an objective, drawing from a slightly adjusted version of the familiar list:

**Kill**: Kill all defenders.

**Render Helpless**: Render defenders helpless and unable to escape for the time being. Killing helpless comrades requires an extremely tougher Composure test to avoid lasting trauma.

**Block**: Stop defenders from moving past you.

**Drive Away**: Keep fighting until the defenders retreat, leaving you safely in control of your current position.

An aggressor can’t select **Escape** as an objective. Until the aggressor starts a fight, the defenders are not a threat to escape from.

**Escape with a Captive**: Grab a defender, then flee to a position of safety no one else is attempting to hold or protect. Pick the defender you want to grab.

**Gain an Item**: Grab a portable, easily seized item held by a defender, then flee with it to a position of safety where defenders can’t interfere with you.

**Overrun**: Get past the defenders, who are physically standing in your way.

Then the defending side defines objectives:

**Kill**: Kill all aggressors. (An unlikely but possible choice.)

**Render Helpless**: Render aggressors helpless and in your custody. Killing helpless comrades requires an extremely tougher Composure test to avoid lasting trauma.

**Block**: Stop aggressors from moving past you.

**Drive Away**: Keep fighting until the aggressors are forced to retreat.

**Escape:** Disengage from, or avoid engagement with, the aggressors, evading any ensuing pursuit.

**Escape with a Captive**: Grab a defender, then flee to a position of safety no one else is attempting to hold or protect. Pick the defender you want to grab. Available only against multiple aggressors; otherwise, choose either Render Helpless or Escape.

**Gain an Item**: Grab a portable, easily seized item held by an aggressor, then flee with it to a position of safety where aggressors can’t interfere with you.

### Specify Weapons

Ask each character to specify the weapons they’re using, if any.

### Assign Difficulties

The base Difficulties for the upcoming Fighting tests start at 4.

Add 2 to the Difficulty for characters fighting to Kill.

Where one side is outnumbered, subtract the number of combatants on the outnumbered side from the number they’re fighting, and add it to the outnumbered side’s Difficulty.

If the GM can see from story context that one side should have an advantage over the other, the disadvantaged group adds 1-2 points to its Difficulty target, with 1 reflecting a detectable advantage and 2 a glaringly significant one.

### Make Fighting Tests

All Combatants make Fighting tests.

### Identify the Victor

When all aggressors fail their tests, the defenders attain their objective, even if all defenders also failed.

When everyone fails, a stalemate results and no one attains their objectives. Both sides suffer embarrassment and possible minor harm, but are unable to resolve their conflict with force.

When at least one aggressor succeeds, the GM asks for each participant’s margin. Add margins for successful combatants to the total for their side, while subtracting margins for characters who failed their tests. Compare the total margins for each side. If the defenders’ total equals or exceeds the aggressors, the defenders win and attain their objectives. Otherwise, the aggressors win and attain theirs.

### Check for Injuries

If a side attained its objective and the objective was Kill, all characters on the losing side make Difficulty 6 Health tests. On a success, the character takes a Major Injury. On a failure, the character immediately dies. A character with two Injuries already in hand will die no matter what, rendering the test redundant.

Losers against opponents who were not trying to Kill take Minor Injuries if they succeeded at Fighting and Major Injuries if they failed. As always, a Final Injury card kills.

Regardless of objective, members of the winning side must pay a Toll of 3, from any combination of Fighting, Athletics, and Health, to avoid injury. Those declining to pay the Toll take a Major Injury if they failed their Fighting tests, and a Minor Injury if they succeeded.

Injuries vary according to the weapons used by the victim’s opponents.

When opponents used differing weapons, the GM decides which one dishes out the Injury. Choose according to the logic of the situation you’ve all described, the weapon wielded by the opponent with the highest test result, or arbitrarily, if no obvious answer presents itself.

**Unarmed**: Bruised/Battered

**Knife**: Nicked/Stabbed

**Blunt Instrument**: Seeing Stars/Dented Skull

**Sword/Other Large Blade**: Superficial Laceration/Run Through

**Gun**: Powder Burn/GSW

### Narrate Results

Knowing who won, and who got injured, guide the players to describe what happens. Invite the aggressors to describe what they’re doing first, then the defenders, then have the victors (if any) lay out the fight’s end conditions.

When multiple characters fight on a single side, start the narration with failed tests first, then move on to the successes.

### Composure Tests

Use this step only if one or more player characters died in the fight.

All participants make Difficulty 6 Composure tests, with the following modifiers:

  - \+2 for each dead character after the first

  - \+1 for aggressors, regardless of who died

  - an additional +1 for aggressors, if one or more defenders died

  - \+1 for defenders, if aggressors died

  - \-2 if aggressors were possessed or otherwise did not choose to attack

Successful tests result in a Minor Shock. Failures get a Major Shock. Aggressors and defenders get different shocks.

**Aggressors**: Blood Debt/Fratricide

**Defenders**: I Should Have Prevented This/Spiral into Violence

## Hazards

Dangers faced outside of combat are called hazards. Hazards can be physical or mental.

### Physical Hazards

Physical hazards can be avoided, or their effects minimized, by making Athletics or Health tests.

Athletics tests apply when harm can be avoided with a quick dodge or other overt, intentional defensive action. Examples include:

  - falling from a great height

  - ducking flying debris

  - leaping out of the way of a plummeting object

  - swimming in a dangerous current

  - leaping over a chasm or between buildings

  - rushing from a flaming building without getting burned

Health tests happen in passive situations where you are exposed to a physical danger and the question that remains is how badly it affects you. This applies to instances of:

  - poisoning

  - sickness

  - exposure

The GM may also call for Health tests when the character has had no chance to actively evade a danger that would otherwise call for an Athletics test. For example, if doused in kerosene and set alight while helpless, a Health test might determine whether the character suffers severe burns, or merely loses some hair and perhaps an eyebrow or two.

Each physical hazard threatens a Minor or a Major Injury, depending on the test result. Characters who succeed are unaffected. On a failure by a margin of 2 or more, they take Major Injury cards. On a failure with a margin of 0 or 1, they take Minor Injury cards.

<span class="smallcaps">Common misreading warning\! Common misreading warning\!</span> For some deep cognitive reason possibly indicating past exposure to a vast, inky alien lake, your brain may want you to remember the above, incorrectly, as success = Minor Injury, failure = Major Injury. That error will death-spiral your characters right quick.

To repeat, the correct rule is:

**Success = no Injury; Failure (margin 0–1) = Minor Injury; Failure (margin 2+) = Major Injury**

GMs can use the following physical hazards as a basis for others. The hazard format is as follows. The “Card Type” line can also note that the card is a Continuity card.

Here is the card format:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Name of Minor Injury</p>
<p><strong>Card Type</strong></p>
<p>Descriptive text including game mechanics if any.</p></td>
<td><p>Name of Major Injury</p>
<p><strong>Card Type</strong></p>
<p>Descriptive text including game mechanics if any.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Here are sample cards, for cases of sea sickness:

Woozy

Injury

Nonlethal. You can’t make Pushes.

Discard when you leave the boat.

Poseidon’s Wrath

Injury

Nonlethal. You can’t make Pushes. -2 to all tests (except Preparedness).

Discard when you leave the boat.

The rest of the Injury cards for hazards appear in the back of the book.

Certain Injury cards gained from fights or hazards can be traded, under conditions specified in their text entries, for less punitive secondary cards. These secondary Injury cards appear in the back of the book, after the main hazard cards. For reference, they are:

Still Hurting

On the Mend

Permanent Injury

Dazed

Jarred

Precarious Recovery

Badly Hurt

Draggy

### Mental Hazards

Mental hazards require characters to make Composure tests.

<span class="smallcaps">O</span>n a **success**, the character **does not take a Shock card**.

On a **failure** with a margin of **0 or 1**, the character takes the Minor Shock card.

On a **failure** with a margin of **2 or more**, the character takes the Major Shock card.

<span class="smallcaps">Again, don’t listen to your brain</span> if it tells you to dole out a Minor card on a success and a Major on a failure.

## Regaining Pushes and Pool Points

Spent points from various pools are restored at different rates, depending on their narrative purpose.

Characters reset to 2 Pushes at the beginning of each new scenario. Most groups finish scenarios over one to three sessions. Players may revise their sense of how carefully to manage point spending as they see how quickly their group typically disposes of its cases.

General ability pools restore at the end of each scenario, or when a long break of world time uneventfully zips by in the course of a scenario. For example, if the group takes a cruise to America in the middle of a case, the time spent playing whist and chatting up fellow scions of the moneyed class while on board allows for a full refresh of all pools. However if they spend all their time on the ship ducking anarchists and discovering the dark secrets of the ship’s crew, they continue to tick away.

#### What Do Pool Points Represent?

Pool points are a literary abstraction, representing the way that characters get their own time in the spotlight in the course of an ensemble drama. When you do something remarkable, you expend a little bit of your spotlight time. More active players will spend their points sooner than less demonstrative ones, unless they carefully pick and choose their moments to shine.

Even when pools are empty, you still have a reasonable chance to succeed at a test, and you’ll always get the information you need to move forward in the case.

Pool points do not represent a resource, tangible or otherwise, in the game world. Players are aware of them, but characters are not. The team members’ ignorance of them is analogous to TV characters’ obliviousness to commercial breaks, the unwritten rules of scene construction, and the tendency of events to heat up during sweeps.

The characters do not literally get worse at doing things as the players expend points.

Instead, the players have used up their share of big spotlight moments they tied to their key abilities.

You may choose to depict this with narration—describing characters as drawn and exhausted when their Athletics pools ebb.

But the system works just as well if you don’t worry about matching literal description to abstract resource.

\[\[END SIDEBAR\]\]

## Improving Abilities

At the conclusion of each scenario, each character gets 1 Improvement point.

Players can spend Improvement points right away, or save them and spend them at any time.

To gain a new Investigative ability, a player spends 2 Improvement points and requests the approval of the player (if any) who received it as part of a starting kit. As GM you may waive this requirement if the latter player is frequently unable to attend game sessions.

Players may add points to a General ability, including those rated at 0, gaining 1 rating point for each Improvement point spent.

### Custom Interpersonal Abilities

Players can add custom Interpersonal abilities to the game as part of improvement. The player must explain how the ability helps the character gain cooperation from others, and give it a name that memorably sums it up.

## Character Replacement

When you lose a character due to physical death or psychic breakdown, create a new one using the standard steps given for the sequence you’re playing.

When choosing your Investigative kit, pick any kit no other player is using. That could be the same one your previous character had, or one nobody picked. If you want, swap out any of those Investigative abilities for any other one available in the current sequence. Don’t swap in more than one ability already possessed by another player’s character.

**\[\[Tough\]\] mode**: Spend the starting amount of build points on General abilities.

**\[\[Forgiving\]\] mode**: Spend the number of build points y0ur departed character had, including both initial build points and Improvement points accumulated in play.

## Foes

### Name of Foe

Descriptive text.

**Numbers**: How many individuals this foe entry represents. A foe might be a singular entity, or a group of combatants. In the latter case, this may vary according to the number of player characters present. This changes the way you narrate the fight but requires no further numerical change to any of the foe’s numbers.

**Difficulty**: Name of Relative Challenge, followed by the Difficulty numbers for the Escape, Other, and Kill goals.

**Difficulty Adjustments**: Conditions under which a bonus or penalty applies to the above Difficulties. A foe might be, for example, harder to fight in the dark, or easier to defeat when characters have burned its copy of a terrible tome or are choosing the Drive Away objective.

**Toll**: Number of points a character who made the Fighting test must spend to avoid taking a Minor Injury. Points may be spent from any combination of Athletics, Fighting, and Health.

**Tags**: \[\[*If desired, assign category identifiers to foes that interact with certain Shock and Injury card effects. List and define those tags here.\]\]*

**Injuries, Minor and Major**: Name of Minor Injury card/Name of Major Injury card

### Alien Assassin

463. Clad in a hooded cloak and armed with a sickle, this mute humanoid slayer has leapt between worlds to wipe out its masters’ foes.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Superior (Escape 3, Other 4, Kill 6)

     **Toll**: 1
     
     **Tags**: Carcosan
     
     1.  **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Stab Wound/Slashed Throat

### Brute

469. A meek, physically unprepossessing aesthete, academic, or scientist might, after discovering a weird science secret, endure periodic transformations into a brute. Muscles ripple to life across his body. His skull thickens and widens. His hair lengthens and coarsens, sprouting from his cheeks, ears, and neck. The meek sufferer’s voice drops an octave, discarding perfect elocution for the patois of the Parisian gutters.
     
     Along with the alterations to his frame and appearance, the brute behaves in a violent and uninhibited manner, indulging all the secret desires and aggressions he has long suppressed. The changes come at dusk; the brute reverts to true form either at dawn or when he falls asleep, whichever happens first. The man behind the brute may clearly recall his nocturnal depredations, understand them as fuzzy dreams, or experience complete amnesia.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Evenly Matched (Escape 3, Other 4, Kill 5)

     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Broken Bone/Knockout Dart

### Civilian with a Gun

483. Use this foe profile when the seemingly innocuous witness a cast member is interviewing suddenly draws a pistol from the desk drawer and fires it. The gun-wielding civilian probably won’t try this when facing more than two opponents, as the prospect of being eventually overwhelmed, disarmed, and arrested becomes a certainty.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Weak (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 3)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -1 for each PC present after the first (penalties for fighting at less than full strength do not apply)
     
     **Toll**: 0

     **Difficulty**: Weak (Escape 1, Other 3, Kill 4)

     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Tags**: Animal
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: The Atavistic Terror of an Animal Attack/Bitten

### Enemy Soldiers

505. For small-scale engagements where the individual skills of combatants determine whether the battlin’ heroes live or die, use these foe profiles.
     
     When the PCs take part in a broader engagement whose outcome they cannot by themselves sway, subject them to war hazards, which they resist with Battlefield tests.

     **Toll**: 3
     
     **Tags**: Carcosan
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Clawed/Eviscerated

### Gargoyle, Solitary

540. Paris’ remaining medieval architecture veritably crawls with gargoyles. Players often choose “I see gargoyles moving on the buildings” as their Deuced Peculiar Business. Animated gargoyles may serve merely as omens in your game. But if it comes to a scrap, here are the numbers.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Evenly Matched (Escape 3, Other 4, Kill 5)
     
     **Toll**: 1
     
     **Tags**: Construct
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Gargoyle Strike/Crushing Gargoyle Strike

### Gargoyles, Pack

546. Use these numbers when an entire group of the stony beasties confront the heroes.
     
     **Numbers**: 3–7 (does not exceed number of characters)
     
     **Difficulty**: Superior (Escape 3, Other 4, Kill 6)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +3 vs. a single character; +2 vs. only two characters
     
     **Toll**: 1
     
     **Tags**: Construct
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Gargoyle Strike/Crushing Gargoyle Strike

### Garguille

553. The dragon of the Seine, sometimes referred to as a giant serpent and supposedly slain by the heroic 7th century bishop St. Romanus of Rouen, might be the ghost of the original dragon, a hallucination given partial substance by ultraterrestrial energy, or an aquatic predator that found a gateway between worlds.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Vastly Superior (Escape 3, Other 6, Kill 7)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -1 if the group has learned the myth of St. Romanus; -1 if one of them wields his sword
     
     **Toll**: 2
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Dragon Claw/Dragon Bite

### Gendarmes

559. These trained police officers outnumber the player character combatants and are more than ready to show that Paris cops have always deserved their reputation for toughness.
     
     **Numbers**: Number of characters × 2
     
     **Difficulty**: Superior (Escape 2, Other 4, Kill 6)

**Adapt to Other Sequences**: Drop Kill by 1

**Toll**: 0

**Injuries, Minor and Major**: Mutant Dog Bite/Mutant Dog Mauling

### Ghost, Vengeful

566. Few ghosts show the inclination or ability to actively attack anyone. Most exist as spectral images frozen in time, mindlessly reenacting moments from the lives they echo.
     
     Others appear to be alive, breathing and corporeal. When a PC meets someone apparently alive and breathing who later turns out to be a ghost, a Difficulty 4 Composure test ensues, to avoid Shock**—Minor**: More Things in Heaven and Earth; **Major**: Anyone Could Be Secretly Dead.
     
     For the rare tormented soul capable of perceiving and harming the living, use this foe profile.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Evenly Matched (Escape 3, Other 4, Kill 5)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -2 on an Occultism spend; -1 if the group knows key facts about the living person
     
     **Toll**: 1
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: “But This is Wondrous Strange\!”/Soul Strike

### Hoodlums

574. Full of fight and low on brains, untrained brawlers like these infest decaying neighborhoods in any timeframe or reality you care to name.
     
     **Numbers**: Number of characters, plus 2
     
     **Difficulty**: Weak (Escape 1, Other 3, Kill 4)

     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +1 if heroes are drunk
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: You Should See the Other Fellow/Concussed

### Horla 

581. As described in Guy de Maupassant’s short story of the same name, the horla is an invisible spirit entity that chooses and haunts an individual victim. By sensing and contemplating the presence of the horla, the victim becomes ever more obsessed by it. Unless somehow able to break its mental hold, the target eventually dies of apparently natural causes. Depending on the case, the victim may succumb to stroke, cardiac arrest, or suicide.
     
     The spread of the horla phenomenon resembles an epidemic. Belief in horla spawns more horla. The first horla outbreak occurred in Brazil nine years ago, and spread to at least one victim in Rouen, who made the simple mistake of waving to a three-masted ship freshly arrived from Rio de Janeiro. In retrospect the investigators might conclude that this was sparked by Carcosan incursion.
     
     Suppressing a horla epidemic can prove difficult, as it involves convincing people that there is no horla epidemic.
     
     Also hard: fighting a horla. It attacks physically only when interlopers try to break its mental hold on its primary victim. It remains invisible, but its position might be intuited from its effect on the surrounding environment. Combatants might see grass or drapery moving, or see its footprints in sand or ripples in a puddle.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Vastly Superior (Escape 3, Other 6, Kill 7)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -1 if heroes have figured out the horla facts given above; -3 if somehow made visible; -1 if a PC cares deeply for this horla’s primary victim
     
     **Toll**: 2
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Steam-Drill Heart/Apoplexy

### Killer Doll

     **Difficulty:** Vastly Superior (Escape 4, Other 4, Kill 7)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments:** -1 if you know the story of the spirit inside the doll; -1 if a character has a blowtorch or other weapon that melts plastic
     
     **Adapt to Other Sequences**: Increase Escape by 1, drop Other by 1
     
     **Toll:** 3
     
     **Tags**: Construct
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major:** Stab Wound/Slashed Throat

### Macabre Experimenter

598. A surgeon or scientist, the macabre experimenter follows a perverse compulsion to reconfigure the anatomies of the helpless. They may justify their grotesque procedures as necessary to breakthroughs that will benefit all mankind. Or perhaps they harbor few illusions about their perverse need. They attack by sneaking up from behind with a syringe full of special tranquilizer formula. After rendering their victims unconscious, they whisk them to their laboratory, likely with the aid of malleable confederates.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Tough but Outmatched (Escape 1, Other 3, Kill 5)
     
     **Adapt to Other Sequences**: Drop Escape by 1; increase Kill by 1
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -1 vs. all but one of main cast; -2 vs. entire cast

     **Adapt to Another Sequence**: Drop Other and Kill by 1
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -1 if you previously succeeded at a Composure test to resist his mental influence; -1 if the party has read the diary in which he records his methods
     
     **Toll**: 2
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Brain Fever/Shown Your Own Horrific Death

### Night Watch 

611. These paid guards, past their prime and probably outnumbered by the protagonists, deter trouble by their presence.
     
     **Numbers**: 2
     
     **Difficulty**: Tough but Outmatched (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 4)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -2 if surprised
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Cracked Skull/Curb Stomped

### Operatives

617. Use this profile for spies and assassins.
     
     **Numbers**: Half the number of characters, or 1, whichever is higher
     
     **Difficulty**: Superior (Escape 2, Other 4, Kill 6)
     
     **Adapt to Other Sequences**: Drop Escape by 1
     
     **Toll**: 1
     
     **Tags**: Human
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Cane Blow/Sword Cane Stab

### Orderlies

624. Keeping patients compliant requires one part medical know-how to three parts muscle. These white-coated working men dispense sedatives and headlocks as required.
     
     **Numbers**: Number of characters, minus 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Tough but Outmatched (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 4)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -1 if the character has First Aid
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Muzzy Headed/Sedated (if attempting sedation)
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Strong Armed/Restrained (if using physical force)

### Patchwork 

631. Someone believing himself to be a modern Prometheus might sew together parts from various corpses and grant animation to the resulting hodgepodge of body parts. The resurrected being gets its intelligence and a semblance of personality from the brain used in the procedure. But if your version of the classic tale runs true to form, the awakening twists that mind into a murderously embittered analogue of its former self. And frankly, who can blame it?
     
     The Patchwork displays a surprising propensity for returning to imitation life after its seeming destruction. Composure tests against Shock upon seeing it increase by 1 each time it comes back for a sequel.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Vastly Superior (Escape 3, Other 6, Kill 7)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +1 if it has reason to think the PCs are in league with its creator; -1 if it has seen them take firm action against its creator
     
     **Toll**: 1

### Peasants, Scythe-Wielding

638. **Numbers**: Number of PCs, plus 3
     
     **Difficulty**: Weak (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 3)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +1 if the characters have previously had friendly interactions with the locals
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Impressive Yet Superficial Cut/Arterial Spray

### Peasant Who Seems Lovely Until You Turn Your Back

643. This is for your classic little old lady or man who appears kindly and helpful until the time comes to get out the hammer.
     
     Use this foe profile only when the civilian intends to knock a character unconscious for the purposes of capture, and only against a soldier who has been separated from the rest of the squad.
     
     First present the player with the “When You Regain Consciousness…” Injury card, offering the choice to take this card in lieu of combat. Explain that use of the Fighting rules gives some chance of winning flat-out, but also risks worse Injury cards in the case of loss. Also, remind the player that in an investigative game waking up in an antagonist’s clutches always provides the opportunity to gain information.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: (*when suddenly attacking an unsuspecting PC*) Overwhelming (Escape 4, Other 7, Kill 7)
     
     (*otherwise*) achieve any combat Goal on a Difficulty 3 simple Fighting test
     
     **Adjust to Other Sequences**: Drop Escape by 1, drop Toll to 0
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Tags**: Mundane
     
     **Encounter Style**: Either
     
     1.  **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Seeing Double/Skull Fracture

### Rakes

654. The rich fathers of these sneering ne’er-do-wells underwrote their study of fencing and fisticuffs before packing them off to Paris to get the havoc out of their system.
     
     **Numbers**: Number of PCs
     
     **Difficulty**: Evenly Matched (Escape 3, Other 4, Kill 5)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +1 in the afternoon (fully sober); -1 at night (drunk); no adjustment in morning (hung over)
     
     **Toll**: 1
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Thrashed/Rapier Wound

### Soul Moths

660. These eerily luminescent alien flying insects feed on emotion and memory. With flicking tongues they drain these from sapient prey, fearing only the King in Yellow and his kin.
     
     **Numbers**: Dozens
     
     **Difficulty**: Weak (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 3)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -1 for each Shock card the player holds
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Fed Upon/Thought Drain

### Alien Spiders

666. These hard-shelled, fist-sized arthropods with gnawing mandibles that saw easily through human flesh can’t technically be described as spiders. The ninth leg affixed to the back of the abdomen, used for leaping, rules that out. Nonetheless, when you see a swarm of them scuttling at you, your first impulse will be to yell “*Spiders*\!”
     
     **Numbers**: Number of PCs
     
     **Difficulty**: Weak (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 3)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +1 for characters holding 1 or more Injury cards
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: The Shudders (Shock)/Sawed Flesh

### Statue (Animated)

672. When you have a sculptor character type and a horror setting, the question is not “Will the characters fight an animated statue?” It is, “How long will it take them to fight an animated statue?”
     
     The player probably supplies the physical description. This foe profile does the rest.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Superior (Escape 3, Other 4, Kill 6)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +1 for each character trying to harm it with bullets, projectiles, or blades; -1 if characters wield heavy artillery or other high-end military weapons
     
     **Toll**: 1
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Fearsome Gut Punch/Broken Jaw

### Students

679. Parisian students fight when drunk and affronted. They are often the former if not always the latter. Investigators can’t kill them without risking pesky murder charges.
     
     **Numbers**: Number of PCs present, plus 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Weak (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 3)
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Roughed Up/Sucker Punched

### Swarm

684. Under alien influence, even the smallest of creatures can pose a threat. When countless vermin animals die together, they form a swarm, a rolling carpet of distorted, quasi-substantial fur, claws, and teeth. Or, when aerial creatures form a swarm, a cloud of beaks, talons, and feathers. Animals that can become swarms include rats, snakes, weasels, dogs, centipedes, birds, and bats. They mindlessly attack any fully living beings they come across, damaging bone and muscle on the molecular level. Wounds dished out by a swarm can’t be seen with the naked eye, but show up when tissue samples are examined under a microscope.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Tough but Outmatched (Escape 2, Other 4, Kill 3)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +1 if anyone dismissed the possibility of a few tiny creatures doing any real harm
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Encounter Style**: Secondary
     
     1.  **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Microscopic Wounds/Cell Damage

### Terror Birds

690. Nine to ten feet tall, equipped with an enormous, flesh-rending beak, this prehistoric avian apex predator can out-run a car, then rip its roof off to get at the delicious humans inside. Unlike more familiar flightless birds like the ostrich and emu, they do not use their clawed feet as weapons.
     
     **Numbers**: 1-2
     
     **Difficulty**: Superior (Escape 2, Other 5, Kill 6)
     
     **Toll**: 1
     
     1.  **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Puncturing Beak/Rending Beak

### Thermosaur

694. A fully aquatic relative of the spinosaurus, the thermosaur is 15 m long and equipped not only with front and back legs but a set of bat-like wings protruding from its shoulders. Though evocative of a dragon, the thermosaur uses these to propel itself through the water, not for flight. The thermosaur requires warm waters and was presumed by the paleontologists who captured it to be traveling along with the gulf stream.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Overwhelming (Escape 3, Other 7, Kill 8)
     
     **Toll**: 2
     
     1.  **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Dinosaur Slash/Dinosaur Bite

### Urban Legend

698. These nominal beings coalesce from the interaction of residual ultraterrestrial energy and the brainwaves of a distressed human mind. These thought forms appear in locations where people become susceptible to negative suggestion, such as haunted houses, graveyards, prisons, and murder scenes. They take the apparent shape of a horror an agitated person unconsciously fears or expects to encounter. Plucking a template from the mind of a tormented onlooker we’ll call an experiencer, they may look like classic ghosts, night hags, or UFO aliens.
     
     Pseudo-entities who manifest by belief can be destroyed by it as well. If an investigator thinks an urban legend has a physical form, that investigator can kill it. However, as soon as an individual encountering one concludes that it’s unreal, it becomes nearly impossible to destroy—for that person, at least. Inconvenient\!
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Evenly Matched (Escape 2, Other 5, Kill 6)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +3 for each PC combatant who knows it’s a shatterling or thinks it’s unreal
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     1.  **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Neuropathic Swipe/Neuropathic Disequilibrium

### Vampires, Fledgling

704. Use these as your flock of recently turned, ferocious but inexperienced bloodsuckers. Their supernatural nature only becomes apparent if provoked to bare their teeth. Resulting Composure tests get a +1 bonus, +2 if the group has killed vampires before.
     
     **Numbers**: 2 fewer than the group (unless this results in 0 vampires, in which case it’s 1 vampire)
     
     **Difficulty**: Tough but Outmatched (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 3)
     
     **Adapt to Other Sequences**: Drop Kill by 1
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: Choose one or two standard vampire vulnerabilities (crosses, garlic, fire) and one oddball one; +1 for PCs using at least one of these measures
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Scratched/Throat Punctures

### Vampire, Legendary

711. If this vampire isn’t Dracula, Carmilla, or Addhema (scalp-stealing antiheroine of Paul Féval’s gonzo 1856 novel *The Vampire Countess*), it can stand toe to toe with them.
     
     If it makes eye contact with a character, it can issue a simple verbal instruction which must be obeyed if the character fails a Composure test. Commands that clearly threaten the life of the victim test against a Difficulty of 8. A command that clearly threatens the life of another PC or an innocent the victim has reason to sympathize with faces a Difficulty of 6. Otherwise the Difficulty is 4. Each time a character succeeds in resisting a vampire’s command, the Difficulty of resisting further commands from any vampire during that scenario decreases by 1, for the duration of the scenario.
     
     Legendary vampires didn’t get that way by being stupid and will generally tailor their commands so that they are likely to be obeyed.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Overwhelming (Escape 4, Other 7, Kill 8)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +5 if heroes are fighting to Kill or Render Helpless but have not investigated sufficiently to know the special means required to dispatch it (stake through the heart, silver bullets, decapitation, or what have you; otherwise, on a kill result, it appears to have been destroyed but then reforms, angry and ready for vengeance. +2 if heroes have tried to kill it before and failed. -4 if this is the last session of the sequence.
     
     **Toll**: 3
     
     **Shocks, Minor and Major**: Enrapturing Bite/Vampiric Death Strike

### Vampire, Solitary

719. Use this vampire when you need a single, moderately powerful example of the breed.
     
     **Numbers**: 1
     
     **Difficulty**: Superior (Escape 3, Other 4, Kill 6)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: Choose one or two standard vampire vulnerabilities (crosses, garlic, fire) and one oddball one; -1 for PCs failing to use at least one of these precautions
     
     **Toll**: 1
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Throat Punctures/Intoxicating Bite

### Viper Swarm

725. **Numbers**: 5 per hero
     
     **Difficulty**: Weak (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 3)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: 0
     
     **Toll**: 2
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Snakes, Our Oldest Fear/Venomous Fangs

### Walking Corpse

730. This dead body has regained animation, but no will or volition*.* It may just wander around frightening people, draining their hold on reality through its very existence. If provoked, by the group or some less altruistic individuals, it becomes a violent attacker.
     
     Unlike a Romero zombie, this does not eat the flesh of the living, nor does it exert a contagion effect on attack survivors.
     
     **Numbers**: 1, or equal to group size
     
     **Difficulty**: Tough but Outmatched (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 4)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: -1 for any Investigator who met the corpse when it was a person; -2 for any Investigator who knew and liked the corpse when it was a person (does not stack with previous penalty)
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Undead Thrashing/Monstrous Mauling

### Yeth-Hound

737. When a child is murdered near a hub of ultraterrestrial activity, weird vibrations gather around it, coalescing into a yeth-hound. These headless, quasi-substantial, canine-shaped beings strike terror into those unfortunate enough to behold them. A newly fledged yeth-hound travels forests and uninhabited byways until it finds a pack to join. Sorcerers can find and command them, forcing them to track or attack specific individuals.
     
     Because the creatures have no apparent heads, investigators may react with surprise when one of them leaps at them and invisible teeth tear through clothing to rend the flesh beneath.
     
     Unless so impelled, they simply range through deep woods, joining each other in a hideous howling that sears the soul of those unlucky enough to hear: Difficulty 6 Composure test to avoid **Shock—Minor:** Unease; **Major**: A Diverting Indiscretion Will Put This in Perspective.
     
     **Numbers**: Twice the number of PCs
     
     **Difficulty**: Weak (Escape 2, Other 3, Kill 3)
     
     **Difficulty Adjustments**: +1 if the group could have avoided a fight but goaded the creatures into it
     
     **Toll**: 0
     
     1.  **Injuries, Minor and Major**: Yeth Bite/Yeth Mauling
