# General Abilities

When attempting actions that don’t directly gather information, and which can lead to engaging story possibilities whether you succeed or fail, use your General Abilities.

General Abilities fall into three categories:

  - Manual \[\[MANUAL ICON\]\], drawing on a combination of skill training and fine motor skills.

  - Mental \[\[MENTAL ICON\]\], drawing on mostly on intellectual study, perception, thought, and/or memory

  - Physical \[\[PHYSICAL ICON\]\], using your gross motor skills.

For each General Ability you have, you will see a number of dice shown on your character sheet. These are your Ability Dice, which you roll, one by one, attempting to avoid a bad result (a Setback), hoping to improve your position (an Advance), but sometimes settling for a middle-ground result (a Hold). The explanation of tests appears on p. XX.

The benefits of Edges and penalties imposed by Problems often specify that they apply to a particular one of these three categories.

To see if you succeed with the use of a General Ability — and, if so, how well — you’ll engage in a Challenge, which we’ll explain shortly. That will make more sense if we first show you what each ability does.

To tune your game to Lovecraftian settings outside the noir framework, you might want to import General Abilities from standard *Trail of Cthulhu* we’ve omitted from this version, such as Piloting \[\[PHYSICAL ICON\]\] and Riding \[\[PHYSICAL ICON\]\]. Other settings may call for the addition and removal of other abilities appropriate to their genre conventions.

## General Ability Definitions

When you’re not sure what a General Ability does, consult these definitions.

#### Athletics (Physical) \[\[PHYSICAL ICON\]\]

Athletics allows you to:

  - perform general acts of physical derring-do, from running to jumping to throwing bundles of dynamite to dodging oncoming objects

  - resist the effects of disease, poisoning, and intoxicants

  - resist the effects of exposure, such as hypothermia, frostbite, and sunstroke

Any big physical action not covered by another ability probably goes here.

Old *GUMSHOE* hands will note that some benefits of the Health ability, which *One-2-One* does not use, have been moved here.

#### Conceal (Manual) \[\[MANUAL ICON\]\]

You can hide things from view and conceal them from searchers. Methods might include camouflage, holding items out on your person, sneaking things into drawers unobserved, building secret compartments, or even altering an object’s visual signature with paint or plaster.

To discover items others have concealed, use the Investigative Ability Evidence Collection. In odd instances where finding the item grants you an advantage other than information — let’s say locating the small Mauser in the false compartment just as Horgan’s torpedoes come through the door — use a Conceal Challenge.

#### Cool (Mental) \[\[MENTAL ICON\]\]

Measures your ability to make the smart play, instead of the impulsive one, in response to emotional temptation. Cool saves you from such standard errors of the private dick game as:

  - > falling for the wrong kind of dame

  - > showing a tell that warns the killer that you know he did it

  - > smart-mouthing the cop who’s itching to club you

  - > hitting the roulette wheel when you know you shouldn't

  - > attempting a futile grand gesture to wring real justice from a rigged system

  - > resist supernatural forces attempting to influence your behavior

#### Devices (Manual) \[\[MANUAL ICON\]\]

You build, repair, and operate electrical or mechanical devices. And what you can put together, you can take apart, disabling equipment either unnoticeably or completely.

You know the workings of electrical devices from simple alarm systems to the most advanced radios. You can also hot-wire a car with an electrical ignition, which is most of those built since 1920. Given the right components, you can create jury-rigged devices from odd bits of scrap.

This expertise also encompasses machines from simple stick traps to the most complex adding machines or steam turbines. (With the exception of simple latches; working with locks is covered by the Locksmith ability). Given the right components, you can create jury-rigged devices and booby-traps from odd bits of scrap.

This doubles as an Investigative Ability when used to:

  - determine the function of a given piece of equipment

  - evaluate the quality of workmanship used to create an item

  - make high-quality audio recordings on records, Dictaphone cylinders, or wire

  - read Morse Code

  - tap telephone or telegraph lines

  - use a device in good repair as intended

Once per case, you may specify that you can operate and (where relevant) drive a new type of heavy machinery, such as: back-hoe, steam roller, construction crane, or steam shovel. Your GM may ask you to supply a line of dialogue explaining where you picked this up.

#### Disguise (Manual) \[\[MANUAL Icon\]\]

You can become someone else: clothes, voice, mannerisms, and posture. You can:

  - > impersonate someone on the phone

  - > blend into a crowd in the street

  - > mingle at a party with those outside your social station

  - > hold an entire conversation with an unwitting friend or suspect

Expect to have to beat a high number in order to Advance while impersonating a real person to their friends or acquaintances. Depending on the situation, impersonating a plausible and even fictitious stranger (“oh, I’m his cousin from upstate New York”) to people one has never met might require only a Difficulty 4 Quick Test.

#### Driving (Manual) \[\[MANUAL ICON\]\]

Anyone who’s been taught can drive a car down the road without this ability. You, on the other hand, are a skilled defensive driver, capable of wringing high performance from even the most recalcitrant automobile, pickup truck, or bus. You can:

  - evade or conduct pursuit

  - avoid collisions, or minimize damage from collisions

  - navigate, read maps, and maintain a sense of direction

The ability assumes you can drive cars, trucks, motorcycles and small motor boats. Once per case, you may reveal that you can drive another type of vehicle requiring specialized training, such as a bus, yacht, plane, tank, or gyrocopter. Where this seems unlikely, the GM may invite you to improvise a line describing the circumstances under which you learned this.

#### Explosives (Manual) \[\[MANUAL ICON\]\]

As an expert in bombs and booby-traps, you can:

  - defuse bombs and traps

  - handle nitroglycerin or other dangerously unstable materials with relative safety

  - given time, blow open safes or vaults without damaging the contents

  - mix explosive compounds from common chemicals

  - safely construct and detonate explosive devices or booby-traps of your own

Explosives doubles as an Investigative Ability when used to:

  - figure out the configuration of a bomb from its blast effect and shrapnel

  - for any bomb (exploded or unexploded), determine the method and materials of the bomb-maker, and deduce his sophistication, background, and skill

#### Fighting (Physical) \[\[PHYSICAL ICON\]\]

Whether duking it out with fists and the occasional kick, defending against an incoming shovel with an opportunistically grabbed two-by-four, or trading pistol shots with hot-tempered gangsters, your Fighting ability dictates the result of the scrap. When facing impossible odds, an Advance or Hold might allow you to engage your enemies favorably enough to launch a successful escape.

This covers all forms of combat, from scuffling to shooting to hand-to-hand weapons. (Multiplayer *Trail of Cthulhu* treats these as three separate abilities. A solo game eliminates the need to give various player characters differently flavored ways to harm opponents, so *One-2-One* collapses them into a single ability).

#### Filch (Manual) \[\[MANUAL ICON\]\]

Your nimble fingers allow you to unobtrusively manipulate small objects. You can:

  - > pilfer clues from (or plant clues at) a crime scene under the very noses of unsuspecting authorities

  - > pick pockets

  - > plant objects on unsuspecting subjects

#### First Aid (Manual) \[\[MANUAL ICON\]\]

You can perform first aid on sick or injured individuals, including yourself. Depending on how the GM structures the Challenge, an Advance or Hold might stabilize the patient, keep him alive just long enough to hear a whispered confession, or fix him up entirely. Injuries the GM describes as relatively minor will be easier to score Advances and Holds on than ones he describes as serious or life-threatening.

#### Fleeing (Physical) \[\[PHYSICAL ICON\]\]

This ability governs how speedily you run away from impending danger, whether it comes from a gambler’s gun, cops intent on locking you up, or a formless entity from beyond space. Used for characters who aren’t otherwise Athletic, to give them some chance of avoiding physical harm. If you don’t have Fleeing, because you instead use the better, all-around ability of Athletics, such Challenges instead default to Athletics.

#### Hypnosis (Mental) \[\[MENTAL ICON\]\]

You can hypnotize a willing subject, recovering lost memories, suppressing unwanted ones, or removing destructive compulsions. Your technique likely involves the use of narcosynthesis, in which you administer a small dose of sodium pentothal to your subject. Treat as an Investigative Ability when gaining information useful to your case. The investigator may submit to narcosynthesis under a supporting character’s care in hopes of Countering Continuity Cards.

#### Magic (Mental) \[\[MENTAL ICON\]\]

Your GM may decide that his version of *Cthulhu Confidential* allows the investigator to eventually learn and practice efficacious magic. This might be used to summon Mythos entities, or bind them once summoned (a crucial step, yet all too often overlooked\!).

A few spells allow sorcerers to harm their opponents directly, or to subject them to mental influence. Use Athletics to resist the former, and Cool for the latter. If your Magic dice exceed your dice in the ability used to resist magic, use Magic instead.

(To my taste, giving a noir detective sorcerous powers veers too far from noir horror into the tongue-in-cheek urban fantasy of the film *Cast a Deadly Spell*. But once you start playing, it’s your game, not mine, so if that’s what you want, do it).

#### Preparedness (Manual) \[\[MENTAL ICON\]\]

You expertly anticipate the needs of any investigation by packing a kit efficiently arranged with necessary gear. Assuming you have immediate access to it, you may be able to produce an object needed to overcome an impediment to your progress. A Quick Test simply determines whether you have the item in question. A Challenge allows you to not only have the object, but also overcome an associated obstacle.

Equipment standard to the private investigation racket does not require a test. This includes but are not limited to: notebooks or paper, writing implements and ink, flashlights, candles and matches, colored chalk, pen-knives, magnifying glasses, pocket mirrors, string, sandwiches, and a flask of middling whiskey.

Other abilities imply the possession of basic gear suitable to their core tasks. Characters with First Aid or Medicine have their own first aid kits or medical bags; Photographers arrive on the scene with cameras, film, and flash bulbs.

Narrative credibility constrains the sorts of items you might have brought with you. If the GM determines that your possession of an item would seem ludicrous, anachronistic, or out of genre, you don’t get to test for it. You simply don’t have it. When in doubt as to allow an item, the GM imagines the film version of your adventure. If the detective’s suddenly having the desired object on hand without prior setup would earn a derisive laugh from moviegoers, the GM disallows the attempt.

#### Psychoanalysis (Mental) \[\[MENTAL ICON\]\]

You can provide comfort, perspective, and solace to the mentally troubled. You may be a Freudian alienist, a priest or pastor, or just an empathetic and intuitive individual. Unlike Reassurance spends, your counsel can aid supporting characters mentally scorched by confrontation with the Mythos. You can’t use your own Psychoanalysis ability to counter your own Continuity Cards.

#### Sense Trouble (Mental) \[\[MENTAL ICON\]\]

This ability allows you to perceive (either with sight or other senses) potential hazards to yourself or others. For example, you can:

  - hear the splash of an Aquatic Humanoid dropping into the sewer behind you

  - see a flittering shape cross the moon

  - have a bad feeling about that eerily hunchbacked priest at the seemingly deserted cathedral

  - notice that those two palookas in the dark corner of the bar have been intently watching you all night long

  - realize that anyone up in that lighthouse will have seen you coming a mile away

You always make Sense Trouble Challenges, even if you get a Hold or Setback and have to play your character as unaware of impending trouble: see p. XX.

GMs should never require the use of this General Ability to find clues to the mystery at hand. Instead, use Investigative Abilities, defaulting to Evidence Collection when no ability seems more appropriate. Sense Trouble applies during a scenario’s action and suspense sequences. In short, if not seeing something will get you attacked or confront you with some other practical ill-consequence, it’s Sense Trouble.

#### Shadowing (Physical) \[\[PHYSICAL ICON\]\]

You follow suspects without revealing your presence. You can:

  - use binoculars or telescopes to keep watch on a target from a distance

  - find undetectable vantage points

  - hide in plain sight

  - anticipate blind spots in your coverage and plan for them, or use them to lose your own shadowers

#### Stability (Mental) \[\[MENTAL ICON\]\]

Remain in control of your thoughts and actions when confronted with frightening or traumatic sights, sounds, or other sensory input. Stability allows you to:

  - > move toward danger a self-protective person would avoid

  - > avoid or suppress physical symptoms of terror and disgust, from nausea to adrenaline rush

  - > appear calm to others, even when terrified inside

  - > file a weird sight deep in your memory, keeping your mind intact by refusing to entertain its true significance

Encounters with the especially destabilizing forces and entities of the Mythos may leave you with a Continuity Card Problem. If you fail to counter it during play, you may suffer a mental breakdown during the story’s denouement.

#### Stealth (Physical) \[\[PHYSICAL ICON\]\]

You’re good at moving (and standing still) without being noticed. You can:

  - move silently

  - hide in shadows or cover

  - evade visual security, whether guards (usual) or cameras (unusual)

  - listen at doors or windows without being overheard yourself

Use Stealth when you are creeping around unnoticed; if you are trying to lose a pursuer, use Shadowing. Outrunning a pursuer is Athletics or Fleeing.
