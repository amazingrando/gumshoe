# Tests

A **test** determines what happens when your investigator tries to do something that might not work. Your GM decides whether your proposed action requires a test. If it doesn't matter to the outcome of the investigation, or if your failure to perform the action offers no interesting story choices, you succeed, no test required.

Two types of tests appear in the game: Quick Tests and Challenges. Challenges are more interesting and require a little more explanation, so we’ll start there.

### Challenges

Challenges occur in situations where degrees of success or failure can send the story into different possible branches, each of them interesting in its own way. Examples include:

  - running away from a creature that surges out of the La Brea tar pits

  - sneaking backstage at the nightclub

  - fixing the car before the yokel with the rifle gets back

Sometimes you know that you'll get what you want, but you are only determining the costs of success (if any).

When you make a test, you describe what your investigator is trying to do. You might directly suggest the General Ability you're using, or your GM may infer it from context.

#### Die Rolls

Make a test by rolling a die. (*GUMSHOE* always uses an ordinary 6-sided die). Each General Ability has a number associated with it — for starting characters, always 1 or 2. This number indicates how many times you may roll the die when testing that ability. When you have multiple dice to roll, roll them one at a time, adding to your total as you go.

#### Outcomes

Your final total determines the **Outcome** of your action. You either:

  - **Advance**, succeeding especially well. This might grant you an Edge card, or allow you extra leverage in the situation at hand.

  - **Hold**, which generally leaves you no worse off than you were before, or allows you to move forward, though without additional benefit. (The occasional especially daunting Challenge may present a Hold that puts you in a tough spot, but which is not nearly as bad as the Setback).

  - endure a **Setback**, worsening your situation. It may saddle you with a Problem card. Or it might simply make your immediate dilemma worse in some way.

Your GM tells you the number you need to meet or beat to score an Advance.

#### Earning Additional Rolls

After rolling any die, you may gain an additional die roll by either spending an applicable Edge or taking on an **Extra** **Problem**.

When you take on an Extra Problem, you commit more to the task, but at a price. Think of it as going into debt, incurring future trouble to overcome your current obstacle. If you Advance or Hold, you leave the situation with only that Problem hanging over your head. If you suffer a Setback, you could wind up with two new Problems: the one listed in the Setback description, and the one you voluntarily took on. You can incur only one Extra Problem per test. Most represent minor setbacks, but a few turn out to be truly nasty. The GM does not reveal the nature of the Extra Problem until the end of the test, making the choice fraught and uncertain.

You may gain one extra die from spending an Edge and another from taking on an Extra Problem. You may never spend two Edges on a single Challenge. No Challenge provides more than one Extra Problem.

#### Bonuses and Penalties from Edges

Some Edges add a bonus to your Outcome for as long as they remain in your hand. Add these bonuses to the first roll.

Others grant bonuses if you choose to discard the card. You can decide to do this at any time.

Problem cards in hand may impose penalties to the Outcome. Factor these in after the first roll. In some cases, a card’s text applies only to your next test of an ability, and the card may then be discarded. Other, less obliging Problems hang around until you Counter them in some other way.

#### Gaining Pushes

When you reach an Advance with dice still unrolled, you gain a Push (p. XX). This might well mean that you got both an Edge and a Push.

If you have an Edge card that allows you to roll an extra die on a test, you can spend it before rolling any of your Ability dice, or wait until you’ve rolled them all. The first option increases your chances of earning a Push. The second lets you wait and see if you really need to spend that Edge on this Challenge, giving you the option of holding onto it for later.

#### Back to the Story

After you have either:

  - equaled or surpassed the number needed for an Advance, or

  - rolled the die as many times as you are allowed and not scored an Advance

...the GM describes the story result of the Outcome, paraphrasing from the narrative text provided in the Challenge (or, if improvising Challenges on the fly, the GM describes the Outcome extemporaneously).

\[\[\[Begin Sidebar\]\]\]

#### Challenge Quick Reference

On an Advance:

  - You **always** get a special benefit, usually including an Edge.

  - If you still have unrolled dice, you **also** get a Push.

On a Hold:

  - You end up neither worse nor better off, taking neither penalties or benefits.

On a Setback:

  - Something bad happens to you in the story, often represented by a Problem.

To increase the chance of gaining an Advance, you may take on an Extra Problem, allowing you to roll an additional die.

\[\[\[End Sidebar\]\]\]

#### Challenge Format

Published investigations present Challenges in the following format:

\[\[\[Begin Challenge BOX\]\]

#### Name of Challenge

***Name of Active Ability***

**Penalty*: ***If applicable, lists a penalty applied to your first die roll under certain circumstances. Most often applies when you have a particular Problem card.

**Advance \#+**: Quick description of what happens in the story when you advance. A published scenario, like the one in this book, may refer you to the main text for more detail. The number is the test's target to Advance. Any result equal to or higher than that lets you Advance. Often you earn an Edge; if so, it is named here.

**Hold \#-\#**: Description of what happens when the Outcome is a Hold. The numbers show the range in which a Hold occurs. The second number is always 1 less than the target to Advance.

**Setback \# or less**: Description of what happens in the story when the Outcome is a Setback. Numbers show the range in which a Setback occurs. Names the Problem you incur, if any.

**Extra Problem**: Describes the most obvious Extra Problem the investigator can take on to gain an additional die against this Challenge.

\[\[\[END Challenge BOX\]\]

Write Challenges in the second person, as if addressed to the character. Here’s an example:

\[\[\[Begin Challenge BOX\]\]

@@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@

#### Sneaking into Jimmie Horgan's Joint

***Stealth***

**Advance 8+**: You get in and out of Horgan's joint unseen, with the contents of the file folder in Horgan's desk. Kicks off the scene “File Folder” below. Gain Edge 3, “Blackmail Photos.”

**Hold 4-7**: You realize that Horgan's men pay much more attention than you’d like to the door you want to sneak through. You can leave without their realizing you were casing the joint, but you'll have to figure out some other way to get that file.

**Setback 3 or less:** Horgan's men confront you. Spend a Push on a suitable Interpersonal ability, or they take you out to the alley to make with the brass knuckles.

**Extra Problem**: Problem 7, “They’re Onto You”

\[\[\[Begin Edge Card\]

@@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@

Blackmail Photos

Spend for an Interpersonal Push when dealing with Horgan or either of the Kane sisters. You have to be willing to show them the photos and portray yourself as ruthless enough to use them.

\[\[\[END Edge Card\]

\[\[\[Begin Problem Card\]

@@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@

They’re Onto You

Horgan and McShane suspect you might be poking into their illegal affairs. They might take action against you if they see you around again.

Until you win back their trust, possibly with a Reassurance Push, you can’t make other Interpersonal Pushes on them.

\[\[\[END Problem Card\]

#### Immediate Consequences

Some Advances confer a bonus or extra die on another test that will happen right away. Some Setbacks impose a penalty. Since they are resolved right away and don’t need to be tracked from one scene to the next, they don’t require the use of Edge or Problem cards.

#### Voluntary Losses

The player can always decide not to engage in a test, but instead to accept the consequences of a Setback result. This might happen when the player decides that failure introduces an interesting or challenging story possibility. Stability and Cool tests are the most likely to inspire a player to take a voluntary loss.

#### Reading Results Text

Snippets of text portray the Advance, Hold, and Setback results as second-person narration, directed at the detective. In some cases, usually in Stability and Cool tests, they may even suggest the character’s perceptions, emotional responses, or thoughts. Although the GM can always read them out verbatim, usually the player will find it more natural to hear them paraphrased into a less polished, but more spontaneous, narration. Where possible, the GM should break this text into small chunks, inviting the player to participate in a back-and-forth dialogue. See the example below.

#### Challenge Example

@@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@

*You undertake the Challenge “Sneaking into Jimmie Horgan’s Joint,” above. You have two Ability Dice in Stealth. The GM tells you that you need an 8 to Advance. You roll the first of your dice and get a 5. That isn’t enough, so you roll again and get a 2, for a total of 7 — still short of your target. You can either accept a Hold result, or take on an Extra Problem in order to get the third die roll that will assure an Advance. You decide to take the Extra Problem, and gain both the Advance (and its “Blackmail Photos” Edge) and the Extra Problem, “They’re Onto You.”*

*The GM paraphrases the Advance text, leaving you spaces to contribute additional narrative detail. “How do you get in?”*

*“I wait until his floor-walkers are distracted by something.”*

*“There’s a big jackpot at the craps table, and a drunk jumps up and down excitedly, drawing everyone’s attention.”*

*“That’s my moment. I slip into the hallway leading to Horgan’s office.”*

*“You see the folder you’re looking for on his desk.”*

*“I grab it and head back out again.”*

*“As you head out, you see McShane on the other side of the casino.”*

*“Uh-oh. Does he see me?”*

*“He sure seems to.”*

*“That’s bum luck. But I got what I needed. Let’s hope it’s worth the price.”*

*The GM then gives you the Extra Problem card.*

## Handling Problems and Edges

These notes guide you in using Edges and Problems during play.

### Formatting

The cards in this game use the following format.

Story material comes first; this is italicised under the heading, and provides a desciption of what prompts the card. Next comes rules material, in regular style; this includes the Ability the card relates to, and then the outcome of an Advance, Hold and Setback result. Any Extra Problems which can be taken are listed at the bottom of the card.

Some cards might not have both - cards omit the story material when their title says everything there is to say: “Stabbed” or “Smashed Headlight” require no further elaboration. Other cards present only story material, leaving the player and GM to weave them into the narrative in the course of play. The four possible opening Problem cards for “The Fathomless Sleep” work this way, for example, as do most Continuity Card cards.

### What “Next” Means

Some Problems apply a penalty to the character’s next test, or next test of a particular type. As a player, you can’t burn off the penalty by using it on a pointless test with no meaningful bearing on the storyline. Only tests called for by the GM or the scenario, or which: a) make narrative sense; and b) threaten to put you in a worse position on a Setback, count as “next tests” for this purpose.

### When Instructions Differ

When the text of an Edge or Problem card contradicts that of a Challenge, treat the card as an exception that takes precedence.

@@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@

For example, the text of a Challenge may specify that Edges applying to tests of General/Physical General Abilities, or Fleeing in particular, can be applied to the present test, in which the detective and an innocent bystander are running away from ghouls. If, however, the player has an Edge called Ghoul Lore, which can be applied to any test where ghouls are present, the card wins out, ignoring the apparently more restrictive Challenge text.

Where the text of a Problem and an Edge conflict, the Edge takes precedence.

### Duplicates

Except where indicated, if you get an Edge or Problem you already have, it is duplicated, adding an additional copy to your stack. In the case of an Edge, this represents a benefit you can use more than once, and/or one that conveys an additional benefit. For a Problem, it means your dilemma has doubled in intensity. You must Counter each card separately, reflecting a dilemma that has just become twice as bad as it was.

Bonuses and penalties “stack,” to use gaming parlance. Add together all active Penalties/Bonuses when applying them to a Challenge.

The text of the Problem “Wrenched Back” reads:

\-2 on your next General/Physical test, -1 on the test after that, then discard.

You have one copy of “Wrenched Back”, and have already applied its -2 penalty to a test. Now you get another. In the following scene you take a fighting Challenge against mind-controlled senators. You take the -1 penalty accruing from the first copy of “Wrenched Back” and the -2 from the second (since this is your first General/Physical test since getting that copy of the card). The total penalty is -3.

### Countering Problems

@@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@

Problems may reduce your range of options in the story at hand. For example, “They’re Onto You” forces you to tread warily around Horgan and McShane, or spend time trying to allay their suspicions.

Problems left unaddressed at the end of the story can lead to a downbeat ending. To prevent your adventure from ending in remorse, dissipation, bruises, or macabre demise, do your best to counter your Problems before the mystery resolves.

To counter a Problem, you must do something that would credibly get it out of your way. This may require a successful Test or the expenditure of a Push or Edge.

Realizing that Horgan is probably onto you, you head over to his office to trade wisecracks. You successfully portray yourself as a go-along-to-get-along type who would never dream of upsetting his applecart. The GM charges you a Reassurance Push to achieve this.

#### Taking Time

The most common way to Counter a problem is to Take Time. When Taking Time, the detective momentarily puts the investigation aside to deal with the issue raised by the problem.

@@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@

Lauren watches from hiding as crooked Broadway producer Sid Diamond and his thugs kill songwriter Danny Munich. She can’t save him, but at least she can try to stay alive to make sure Diamond later faces justice. The scenario calls for a Cool Challenge not to gasp in horror as they beat Danny to death. As player, you elect to take on an Extra Problem to make sure you get at least a Hold, and manage to stay silent. You do, but are left with this card:

<sup>\[\[\[Begin Problem Card\]</sup>

Facial Twitch

Your rational mind knows you had no way to save Danny. The rest of you isn’t so quick to forgive. Inner turmoil manifests itself as an incessantly twitching left eye.

You can’t Push Interpersonal Abilities. Counter by Taking Time to mentally regroup.

Problem \#

<sup>\[\[\[END Problem Card\]</sup>

How exactly you mentally regroup depends on how you choose to describe it. Your particular interpretation of Lauren paints her as a hard-charging type who releases her frustrations physically. You tell the GM she’s headed to her all-woman sparring club to sock a punching bag into submission, imagining all the while that it’s Sid Diamond’s contemptuously grinning face. This gets rid of that twitch. You discard the card.

In a few cases, Taking Time may require a Quick Test or Challenge. More often the player simply describes a brief interlude scene. The text of certain Problem cards explicitly indicates what this scene might look like. The GM may decide that your alternate solution works better than the suggested one. Players can also suggest ways to Take Time to get rid of Problems whose text doesn’t describe a Counter at all.

Unless specified in the card text, Taking Time never removes a Problem marked as a Continuity Card (p. XX).

Taking Time is not without cost. Some scenarios may find your character working against the clock to accomplish a particular end: getting the antidote before the client succumbs to poison, finding the bomb before it goes off, or rescuing the kidnap victim before the cultists ritually strangle him.

Without a deadline, Taking Time typically gives enemies, rivals, and nuisances time to make moves against you they otherwise couldn't. These incidents, called Antagonist Reactions, are described for GMs on p. XX.

### Quick Tests

On occasion, your detective may face a very straightforward obstacle where you can only succeed or fail, with no particular ongoing advantages or disadvantages arising from the result. In this case, you undertake a Quick Test. If you hit the Advance number, you succeed. If not, you fail, but nothing especially bad happens. You don’t gain Edge or Problem cards from the Outcome of a Quick Test. Although you can spend an Edge to gain an extra die on a Quick Test, the GM will warn you that it carries lower stakes than a full Challenge and therefore might not be worth it. Although ongoing Penalties from Problem cards apply to Quick Tests, you may not discard the Problem card.

GMs choose Quick Tests for situations where big positive or negative results are either hard to think of, or would take the story in an annoying or fruitless direction. Quick Test Difficulties should range from 3-4.

@@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@

Let’s say Lauren wants to sneak into a skyscraper’s telephone room in hopes of overhearing any dish its operators might have on the building’s resident business tycoon, Eli Parnham. With Lauren’s Disguise ability, it’s entirely possible that some players will try to put it to use here, having her show up in an operator’s uniform and pretend to be a new hire. Lauren could approach the operators in a less extravagant way and get the same information. But when you put Disguise on the character card, some players are gonna want to use it...

Preparing for this eventuality, the scenario’s designer, Ruth, considers all the possible Setbacks that would result if Lauren gets caught. That would let Parnham know she’s looking into him, but he’s not the culprit anyway. Rival reporter Lawrence Ames might toss her some wisecracks about promoting her to the phone pool the next time she pops into the office. Any more serious consequences would pull Lauren away from the main plotline, toward petty annoyance. Rather than try to force this into the Challenge format, Ruth decides to use a Quick Test.

If you have trouble thinking of Problems, including Extra Problems, for a Challenge, that’s a sign that you should probably replace it with a Quick Test.

Where the result lacks any whiff of danger or great import, skip even the Quick Test and allow the ability use to succeed automatically.

Sometimes you'll envision a possible Challenge for which you can think of only two Outcomes. As long as there’s an Edge or Problem to arise from it, it’s still a Challenge, not a Quick Test.

#### Challenge, Quick Test, or Neither?

\[\[\[\[Begin Sidebar\]\]\]

### No Secret Tests

On occasion, the GM may be tempted to make a secret Challenge roll on the player’s behalf.

The classic example occurs with Sense Trouble, a General Ability allowing the character to react quickly to approaching danger. A GM might reason that the player should not be tipped off if the character fails to notice something wrong.

In practice, it is almost always more effective to tip the player off by requesting a test, but in the case of failure, to withhold knowledge of what exactly the character didn’t spot. Think of this generalized idea that something has been missed as the roleplaying equivalent of ominous music playing on the soundtrack, or an eerily composed shot from overhead. Should the player attempt to have the character act on the sense of unease, all the GM has to do is ask her to justify why it makes sense to do so. If she can, well, it makes sense, so allow it. If not, she'll relent, no harm, no foul.

*One-2-One* requires this level of transparency, because the player usually has the option to make a sacrifice, either spending an Edge or taking on an extra Problem, to increase her chance of success.

You may have noted that the game is entirely player-facing, meaning that the player makes all rolls, and the GM never touches a die. Secret tests would break that principle.

In practice, you can frame most Challenges so that the bad results of a Hold or dire ones of a Setback become immediately apparent anyway: the mountain lion leaps from behind the bush, Langston grows woozy after drinking the boilermaker with the mickey in it, and so on.

### Fights

Mystery stories featuring extended fight sequences are rare exceptions in film, TV and fiction. In multiplayer *GUMSHOE*, fights can nonetheless provide fun and excitement, without stopping the entire story dead when a player character bites the dust. The survivors mourn their loss and carry on the investigation as the player gets to work creating a new character.

In *One-2-One*, that won’t do. The death of a sole protagonist takes a much greater toll on the story than the demise of one team member. When you set aside the possibility of death as a result, tactical choices lose their impact. So we omit these as well, providing a much more abstract combat system than multiplayer *GUMSHOE* — which compared to other RPGs is already plenty abstract.

A fight plays out like any other Challenge, using your Fighting ability. Describe yourself attacking in a way that fits your character as you perceive it: with guns, fists, hand-to-hand weapons, conveniently grabbed objects, or a combination thereof based on circumstances.

In some cases, facts you learn about opponents may help you when it comes time to fight them, granting you a Bonus on your Fighting test.

#### Fight Outcomes

The GM spells out fight results like those of any other Challenge. Each fight may have different consequences, as seen in its description:

\[\[\[Begin Challenge BOX\]\]

#### Aquatic Humanoid Fight

***Fighting***

**Advance 7+**: The Aquatic Humanoid flees, shrieking, and dives back into the sea cave. You gain access to the secret grotto, with half an hour before any of its fellow creatures show up. Gain Edge 8, “Fish-Cutting Blade.”

**Hold 4-6**: You realize that the Aquatic Humanoid will slash you to bits if you persist in trying to enter the grotto. You can safely withdraw to your Packard. It does not pursue you.

**Setback 3 or less:** You wake up in the grotto, chained to a sacrificial altar. See the “Grotto Altar” scene.

**Extra Problem**: Problem 11, “Clawed by Aquatic Humanoids.”

<sup>\[\[\[END Challenge BOX\]\]</sup>

\[\[\[Begin Edge Card\]

Fish-Cutting Blade

**Continuity**

A weird knife made from an alloy of steel and jade. Is that even possible?

Spend for an extra die in a Fighting Challenge against Aquatic Humanoids, or to counter a Continuity Card.

<sup>\[\[\[END Edge Card\]</sup>

\[\[\[Begin Problem Card\]

Clawed by Aquatic Humanoids

You have been slashed by the frog-like claw of an Aquatic Humanoid. It hurts like hell and a weird liquid seeps from the wound. You’d better get that taken care of.

\-2 on all General/Physical and -1 on all General/Manual tests until you Take Time to Counter this card.

Problem \#\]

<sup>\[\[\[END Problem Card\]</sup>

This way of portraying fights lets the GM frame Challenges to exclude results that disrupt the flow of a single-protagonist narrative. On a Setback, Lauren doesn’t die hideously; she crawls away, shaken but still able to continue her investigation. On an Advance, she doesn’t kill an antagonist whose premature exit from the story will preclude its most entertaining coming scenes, or render her ability to remain at large implausible. She gets something out of winning, but the bad guy still limps on, allowing the story to retain the satisfying shape and logic we expect from a mystery story.

### Stability Tests

As hard as you might be boiled, when you witness acts of shattering violence, or confront unearthly horrors, the psychic trauma you undergo may lead to problems later. To see whether this happens, and to what extent, test your Stability General Ability against a target to Advance pegged to the severity of the incident. These Challenges work like any other. On Setbacks you take on Problem cards describing the specifics of your deteriorating mood and grasp of reality. These might be Continuity Card cards, arising from incidents that awaken your mind to dread cosmic truths. They may or may not be Continuity cards, which carry over into later scenarios if not somehow Countered.

\[\[\[Begin Challenge Box\]\]

#### Car Wreck

@@@REWRITE EXAMPLE TO FIT YOUR SETTING@@@

*You discover a roadster at the bottom of the ravine. Leona Farr, the starlet behind the wheel, has been decapitated. You nearly trip over her blond-tressed head.*

***Stability***

**Advance 8+**: Aside from a momentary wince, the awful sight means nothing to you. Gain Edge 7, “Cool Customer.”

**Hold 5-7**: Though visibly shaken throughout the ensuing scene, you are able to take the awful sight in stride. Leona’s head might pop up in future nightmares from time to time, but most days you won’t think about it at all.

**Setback 4 or less**: This sight will haunt you for a long time to come. Gain Problem “Decapitated Starlet.”

**Extra Problem**: Problem 13, “Vengeful”

<sup>\[\[\[END Challenge Box\]\]</sup>

\[\[\[Begin Edge Card\]

Cool Customer

<sup>\[\[\[END Problem Card\]</sup>

\[\[\[Begin Problem Card\]

Vengeful

If you find out who killed Leona, you will be compelled to avenge her, risks be damned.

Problem \#

<sup>\[\[\[END Problem Card\]</sup>

#### Tagged Cards

*\[\[You may decide that a certain class of cards, identified with a tag specific to your setting, is especially hard to shake, with lasting ill consequences that continue from one scenario to the next. You probably want to give them a snappy, setting-specific name.\]\]*

When you still have Problem cards at the end of a scenario, Stability Problems arising from brushes with the Mythos take precedence over all others in the bleak fate your character faces. These are called \[\[Tag\]\] Cards.

\[\[Tag\]\] Cards can never be Countered for free, or by Taking Time. To get rid of them, you must spend Edges. Only Edges marked as spendable on \[\[Tag\]\] Cards can be used for this purpose. It might take more than one Edge to get rid of an especially awful \[\[Tag\]\] Card.

\[\[Begin Challenge BOX\]\]

#### Unwrapping the Painting

***Stability***

**Advance 9+**: Sure, the picture is realistically rendered, but you don’t let yourself believe that it was painted from an actual model. It’s a work of fantasy. It has to be\! Earn Edge 7. “Mighty Disbelief.”

**Hold 5-8**: The painting unnerves you, but no more than a grisly crime scene photo.

**Setback 4 or less:** Problem 12, “Eros and Thanatos.”

**Spending Edges**: Any Edge that counters a \[\[Tag\]\] card.

**Extra Problem**: Problem 13, “Censorious Urge.”

<sup>\[\[\[END Challenge BOX\]\]</sup>
