# Improvements

Assuming your character survived with mind and body intact, at the end of each case, you can add one of the following:

  - an Investigative Ability you lack

  - a **tick** on a General Ability

A tick moves you incrementally toward a rating improvement in a General Ability. You gain no more than 1 tick per ability per case. Once you have 3 ticks in a General Ability, you cash them in to improve a rating from 1 to 2, or from 2 to 3.

General Abilities may never exceed 3.

Your total dice in Cool and Stability combined can never exceed 4.

You can take a tick in a General Ability you donâ€™t have. Once you hit three ticks you get the ability, at one die. Be sure to take actions in each adventure justifying your eventual acquisition of the new ability.
