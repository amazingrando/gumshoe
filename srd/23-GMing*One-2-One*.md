# GMing *One-2-One*

This chapter, addressed to the GM, shows you how to run the game for the player.

## Intensity Management

In our responses from playtesters to this game, one theme stood out above all others: the one player, one GM format makes for an intense, intimate experience. Tension increases without other players to fall back on. The sole player remains constantly in the spotlight, without opportunities to sit back while others take the lead. Responsibility for thinking of the right questions and looking for information in the right places rests with your one player, who has to solve the puzzle without bouncing ideas off others. Nor is there any emotional respite from the bursts of lighthearted out-of-character kibitzing, banter, and digression that often relieve tensions in multiplayer games.

In the story, the character walks the mean streets alone, much more vulnerable to danger than a gang of well-armed investigators ready to defend one another from enemies. Consistent with the physical realism expected from a hard-boiled detective tale, an outnumbered investigator fights to get away unscathed, and does not hope to beat up four or five goons like the hero of an action movie.

Because the format inherently keeps the pressure on your solo player, as the GM you may find yourself looking for ways to give the player hope and confidence. Where most games contrive situations to make sure that the player characters physically overcome any final threats, here the detective can call in the cops or other reinforcements to handle the apprehensions — after she figures out who needs apprehending. This is what happens in the source material; it does not by definition deprive the hero of agency.

(Are you adapting *One-2-One* to a more outlandishly stylized genre? Your samurai, *wuxia* or time agent detective might well lay waste to large teams of lowly henchmen in a single flurry of blows. Making that work requires only that you adjust the outcome descriptions as you write up Challenges. In these instances, you’re relaxing tension by portraying a more forgiving universe, rather than easing up on the apparent difficulty of actions in an unforgiving one).

## Guiding the Player

When the feeling of the solo format threatens to turn the tension of individual play into the pressure of an overwhelming problem, act as a partner and guide your player through the story.

### How to Dislodge a Stuck Player Gently

Detectives in fiction — not to mention in real life — often reach a point where they hit a wall and can’t think where to go next. There’s nothing wrong with that happening to a game character. These moments of frustration intensify the feeling of triumph that comes from finally solving a puzzle. But they have to be moments, and not long stretches of frustrated stasis.

As the GM, you must expect to do more than you would in a multiplayer game to subtly point a stuck player toward the next fruitful lead. Before intervening, though, be sure that the player really has become stymied, and isn’t just thinking things through.

You have the scenario in front of you, so you know what leads the character has yet to investigate, what has been learned but forgotten, and what might have been uncovered had a previous scene unfolded differently. Depending on the situation, it might be most helpful to:

  - review with the player the list of leads that haven’t yet been looked into

  - review what the investigator knows so far

  - mention lingering questions from previous scenes that cry out for follow-up

The balance between gesturing toward the right track and leading the player by the nose is easier to strike in practice than it is to talk about in theory. A quick verbal nudge is often all it takes to prompt the player toward the needed intuitive leap and choose a course of action.

### Common Sticking Points

Players tend to get stuck for a few common reasons.

1.  **Not wanting to talk to people**. Especially in the days of the internet, we’d rather get information from impersonal sources than engage with other people who might confuse, threaten, or embarrass us. Yet the detective genre depends on characters being willing to put themselves out there and engage in face-to-face questioning scenes; only by this means can they get the kinds of information that no one willingly commits to paper. Nudge the player toward actual conversations.

2.  **Especially not wanting to talk to scary people**. Players sometimes unconsciously remove from their mental list of leads encounters with GMCs whom they have good reason to fear. This came up more than once in test runs of “The Fathomless Sleep”, with players blanking on Mickey Cohen as a person to talk to. Remind the player that *Cthulhu Confidential*, which is noir as well as horror, expects investigators to be willing to talk to dangerous types.

3.  **Not wanting to talk in person**. Your player may try to protect the character by conducting interviews over the phone instead of in person. Remind the player that that same distance protects the witnesses from giving themselves away. Key interpersonal abilities like Intimidation, Reassurance — and, perhaps most importantly, Assess Honesty — don’t work with Ma Bell standing in the way. Sometimes you have to look a mug right in the kisser to see if he’s on the up-and-up.

4.  **Adopting too false a false persona**. To protect themselves from probable bad guys, players sometimes describe their detectives as approaching them under false pretenses. This happens in the source material, too, but it only works with a persona allowing the detective to ask the key questions. More than one “The Fathomless Sleep” player had Dex pretend to be an interested spiritual seeker when meeting Clara Nebel and/or William Pelley. After a certain point this made it hard to ask questions about Helen Deakin’s disappearance. Address this by reminding the player, as she chooses her fake story, that it has to let her get at the key facts.

5.  **Needing to re-interview.** Often the player has missed a key point and should go back to a witness or suspect for more information. Remind the player that there is no shame in this. Happens all the time, in both fictional and real-world investigation.

In the appendix, on p. XX, you’ll find a handy player-nudging shortcut, a handout called “How to Solve a Case.” Provide it to your player in advance. When your player gets stuck, getting him back on the right track may be as simple a matter as pointing to the relevant bullet point.

### “As a Seasoned Detective...”

Some hints can be fed to the player by reminding them of that the character knows more about investigative technique than they do:

  - “As a seasoned detective, Lauren would consider a stake-out here.”

  - “Lauren’s journalistic instincts tell her she’s going to have to go down into that basement.”

  - “Lauren has learned that sometimes you have to press witnesses like this a little harder, whatever the risks.”

This framing shows the *character* behaving with confidence and competence, even when the player is a little unsure.

### Sources: They’re Here to Help

Some players go to a Source only as a last resort, while others go off to jaw with their Sources between every Core scene. If the second approach works for the player, make it work for you. Sources exist to provide a sense of comfort and solidarity in a lonely noir world. Let the player gain support from them.

The player may use them as a way for you to act as a sounding board, in-character. Embrace that.

When they ask questions of Sources that the scenario puts in the mouths of GMCs, by all means dole out any clues that might logically arise from their specialized knowledge, remembering that they can’t duplicate the direct experiences of witnesses in the case. But if, say, the scenario expects Langston to learn from an Air Force contact that the film of a UFO sighting has no photographic defects and seems genuine, he could just as easily go consult Scout Moore, his usual Source for the Photography ability.

### Giving Out Clues

As you begin your scenario, you and the player will quickly fall into a rhythm of information dispersal. Don’t let any advice given here stop you from giving out clues in a way that feels natural to both of you.

Some players want to make frequent reference to their abilities. They want to call the shots by describing what their characters do to find clues.

Others prefer to have you supply lots of information without mentioning abilities by name.

Most fall in between, depending on the instance at hand.

Be alert to cues, and follow your player’s lead. Every GM/player duo will do this a little differently.

### Saying Yes to Interpretation

When a player wants to deviate from the backgrounds provided for the characters, and you can’t see any specific reason why that would prevent part of the scenario from taking place, say yes. For that matter, if you can see how to change that scenario roadblock and still say yes, say yes. We present detective personality details as a starting point, not to force you to play according to some established canon. As soon as you start playing with them, Viv, Langston and Dex become yours. Dex in particular appears as a set of genre tropes, waiting for players to fill in the details.

### Puncturing Excess Tension

When you see your player struggling with the pressure of being onstage all the time, look for ways to lighten the mood, to give her time to think, or both. Ease off the Antagonist Reactions (p. XX), for example, when the player needs clearly needs a drop in tension.

You might insert a low-stakes Source scene to give a player needed breathing room. Lt. Hartman might show up to ask Langston if he wants to go on a hike in Rock Creek Park. Louisa Reynolds could insist that Viv join her at the Cotton Club to see Cab Calloway perform.

One player implemented the awesome idea of having Dex pause for journaling breaks, in which she reminded herself of where he was in the case while supplying his hardboiled voice-over narration. This had the extra advantage of giving the GM time to think and regroup, too.

#### How Long Are Sessions?

Though written with the expectation of a four-hour play session per scenario, playtesters reported widely varying results. In the case of “The Fathomless Sleep”, they ranged from a ruthlessly efficient three hours to an epic nine hours.

Short or long, everyone enjoyed the lengths they wound up playing. In a solo game, pacing is about going at the speed the player dictates.

Plan for four hours, but prepare to be surprised.

\[\[\[End Sidebar\]\]\]

### Why Scenarios Go Deep

*GUMSHOE One-2-One* twins simple rules with complex, layered scenarios. They aim to give the feeling of depth you get from the tangled conspiracies of a Raymond Chandler novel.

With the benefit of playtesting, we sure hope we have avoided creating anything like the famous story wherein William Faulker and Leigh Brackett, writing Howard Hawks’ film adaptation of *The Big Sleep*, asked who killed a minor character, chauffeur Owen Taylor. Hawks’ telegram to Chandler elicited the response: “Damned if I know.”

This “probably-happened” fable highlights the challenge of writing complex mysteries.

The interactive nature of RPGs means that you can’t depend on your leading characters not to examine the weak parts of your storyline. Players poke at plot holes. With a group game, discussions between players can save your bacon by helping to cover these holes up. A group may float enough alternate theories of the case to throw a veil of useful confusion over any plot inconsistencies you may accidentally introduce. In solo play, the case becomes clearer — and falls apart if the player finds something that couldn’t have happened the way you thought it did.

For this reason, the game focuses on preparation over improvisation. You can still improvise, but it’s tough, even for an experienced GM. If you don’t trust me on that, ask Owen Taylor.

### Reacting to the Unexpected

That said, no amount of preparation allows you to anticipate every possible player move. Use the sample Challenges starting on p. XX and the sample Edges and Problems in the Appendix as baselines to adapt to any surprises. Don’t be afraid to rely on Quick Tests until the storyline loops back into territory laid out in the written scenario.

## Running Sources

The witnesses, suspects, and clients of the mystery at hand often create dramatic tension by peppering the protagonist with verbal barbs and jabs, or by getting under his skin in other ways. Sources provide a welcome contrast to the charged and antagonistic dialogue scenes that make up the bulk of a scenario. They invite the detective to take the load off, perhaps light up one of the period’s ubiquitous cigarettes, and enjoy a belt of the hard stuff. Sources not only divulge clues, they also provide an emotional up-note. Always play these sequences as low-key, collegial moments.

In addition to information, the player might go to Sources to counter Problems.

### Threatening Sources

If your player ventures the thought that your hard-boiled Mythos tales lack trauma and horror, then you might ratchet up the stakes by placing Sources directly in danger. Killing them off in mid-case might provide a tough shock. For deeply sustained suspense, use a Problem card to hang the threat of a Source’s demise over the detective like the proverbial sword.

\[\[\[Begin Problem Card\]

Max Poisoned

You didn’t get to Max before he drank the gin laced with the strange potion. If you don’t get the antidote by the end of the case, he’s doomed.

Problem \#

<sup>\[\[\[END Problem Card\]</sup>

#### Replacing Sources

Allowing Sources to become potential victims raises the prospect of having to replace them. If a deceased Source leaves the detective without someone to consult on an area of expertise, you can either:

  - ask the player to describe someone else the character already knows who might be able to fill him in

  - have the character seek out, and make a cold approach to, a suitable expert as part of the investigation at hand

## Running Challenges

Challenges presented in published scenarios include text in the second person, addressed to the detective. Paraphrase it naturally rather than simply reading it aloud out of the book or from your screen. Better yet, briefly encapsulate what has happened and invite the player to describe the action.

Often you’ll have to treat results text as a guideline only, adjusting details to fit the way you and the player have already described events in the scene.

### Suicidal Choices and Other Ridiculousness

Most players have their detective make only those choices that arise credibly from the situations you describe. When confronted by a dozen goons and their baseball bats at a migrant worker camp, a sensible player doesn’t say, “I leap in and attack them all at once.” When stuck on top of a construction crane two hundred feet above the pavement they don’t describe themselves leaping off and hoping for the best. They don’t even consider such nonsensical options. They’re buying into the basic premise of the exercise, in hopes of having the fun it promises.

A small number of roleplayers enjoy rejecting a game’s premise and attempting to subvert it by exposing its alleged loopholes and logical errors. This is the RPG equivalent of having more fun dismantling toys than playing with them.

Players who fit this profile could, one imagines, react to *One-2-One*’s idea that death and other story-ending consequences only happen after the case wraps up by proposing the ridiculous or suicidal actions described above.

“If I don’t die until the end, that means I’m immortal until then\!”

That’s definitely what Igor from John Kovalic’s *Dork Tower* comic would conclude, and therefore it’s definitely wrong.

Simply respond to such literalists by explaining that the character knows what would doom him, and is smarter than that, even if the player controlling his actions isn’t. Ask the player if he really wants to end the story in the middle on a note of complete anticlimactic absurdity.

Better yet, if you know that someone takes this adversarial approach to GMs and rules sets, find someone else to play with. In *One-2-One*, you only need one player, and with virtual tabletops you have a whole world full of genuinely collaborative partners to choose from.

Sometimes a player will propose a seemingly absurd or suicidal action out of sincere confusion. Always check to make sure you haven’t mis-described the situation in a way that makes an action that seems ludicrous to you look perfectly sensible to the player.

\[\[\[Begin Sidebar\]\]\]

#### Sudden Endings

In some rare cases the story may take you to a place where it feels appropriately conclusive for the character to fail fatally, even though the case has not yet been solved.

If, and *only* if, the player wants it, let it happen. Join together in describing the horrific glory of it all.

\[\[\[End Sidebar\]\]\]

### Interpreting Edges

Treat listed benefits from Edges as a starting point, not a stricture. If you or your player see an entertaining equivalent benefit for an Edge, by all means exercise your creativity.

Some Edge cards list narrative possibilities without mechanics. Take license to apply these mechanically as feels apropos.

Capitol Colour’s “Big Spender” card merely states that Langston doesn’t have to worry about money. But if Langston's player proposes it, he might be able to discard the card to get a free Push on his Bargain ability. In the story, this might play out as Langston spending the whole haul on a massive but useful bribe.

As you can see from the Edges given in this book, not all are created equal. For some to exert a strong impact on the player, others have to be a little less impressive than the norm. Storytelling is all about rhythm, pal.

## Creating Investigators

If something terrible happens to the character at the end of a case, you may have to create a new detective to solve cases in your chosen city.

Character cards reflect the basic abilities required for mysteries in this genre. Ask the player if she cares whether the new investigator has the exact same list of optimal skills. If she says no, just change the character’s name, pick a different defining Problem at the top of the next case, and you’re off to the races.

Alternately, the player can choose to swap out any Investigative Abilities for others. Tread especially carefully when dropping Interpersonal Abilities, the reliable warhorses of any hardboiled mystery.

In the case of General Abilities, the player can swap out any ability for any one not listed on Dex’s card, giving the new ability the same number of dice as the one she’s dropping. To maintain some degree of emotional vulnerability essential to both horror and noir, the character can never start play with more than 3 dice total divided between Cool and Stability. Entirely dropping a frequently called-upon General Ability will lead to a lot of failures, so we advise caution there, too.

When creating a detective from scratch, a good starting point is to have 14 or so Investigative Abilities, and around 18 dice in General Abilities, with no single ability exceeding 2 dice. You can go up or down a few points in either case, as you’re not worrying about maintaining a sense of equality between multiple players. Basically you’re looking to strike a balance between too many abilities to remember and not enough to feel competent. Stick to the above-mentioned Cool/Stability limit (p. XX), though.

## Creating Scenarios

Start by creating and running mysteries that use \[\[Name of Your Intro scenario\]\]” as a model. Go read that now, if you haven’t already.

As you become more experienced, you may decide that the formula used there bears infinite variation. Or you may experiment, branching out to other structures of your own devising.

### Premise

Start by establishing the question the detective must answer, along with the answer to that question.

### The Whos and the Whys

Now fill in the events that led to the answer, as driven by the characters who made them happened. Together these two elements fill in the scenario’s **Cast**, and a cohesive summary of **What Happened**.

Double-crosses and gangland conspiracies make up the web which any noir detective must then untangle. These essential plot devices that fuel the genre.

Flesh out the Cast with additional witnesses, informants, and ancillary conspirators. Any good mystery requires likely alternate suspects whom the detective must rule out before settling on the true culprit. Give these characters secrets they wish to conceal, or other factors that make them look guilty. Actually *being* guilty of other offenses, connected to the main plot or not, always works splendidly.

A timeline of events will help you run the scenario. The process of assembling it may help reveal logical holes in your storyline. Better to fix them in advance than have to scramble when the player finds them, mid-game.

### Creating Starting Problems

Now step back for a moment and see if your detective needs an introductory Problem, like the four given in the opener for “The Fathomless Sleep.”

If you’ve already run at least one scenario for your player, the detective probably has some lingering Problems still in hand. In that case, write an introduction that connects the most salient of those Problems to the assignment given in the first scene.

New starting Problems become necessary only for introductory scenarios featuring a new detective character, or when the last adventure allowed the detective to dispense of all significant Problems. Always create three or four of them to give the player a sense of control over the character’s story arc. Some players prefer to invent their own, and are good at it. Whenever you can offload narrative tasks onto the player, seize the opportunity. This works best when you have enough lead time to ensure that the player-created Problem can have an impact in one or more places in the scenario. A strong Problem can be plugged into any story in its genre without significant work on your part. When you can’t see a way to build consequences for a player-proposed Problem into your case, ask the player to propose a different one. Plenty of players would sooner pick from several options you supply than have to invent one from whole cloth.

Write Problems you create in a general manner, allowing the player to customize them with specific detail when you play the scene out.

In the case of a new installment of an ongoing series, when you run the scene, invite the player to explain how this new Problem came to bedevil the detective since last time.

### Introductory Scene

Devise an introductory scene that references the detective’s ongoing Problem, and then presents him with the case and its fundamental question. Set this in the standard starting location associated with this investigator — such as that classic opening, “a dame walked into my office” — or switch up the formula to place the meeting with the client somewhere else. The investigator might be summoned to the office or abode of a wealthy or powerful client; a furtive client might request a meeting on neutral ground, like a coffee shop, nightclub or athletic club. Otherwise, the introductory scene should contain the elements of any other, as detailed below.

### Anatomy of a Scene

Scenes in published *GUMSHOE* scenarios start with header entries to help the GM quickly spot their purpose and place in the flow of the case.

#### Scene Types

The Scene Type header entry shows the GM the scene’s purpose.

An **Introduction** scene starts the story. It kicks off the case, presents the detective with the question that must be answered, and probably introduces a client. It also contains the elements of a Core scene:

A **Core** scene provides enough information for the detective to move onto another scene, and deeper into the central mystery, so long as the detective asks the right questions and looks in the right place.

An **Alternate** scene presents a colorful, tense, diverting, or otherwise entertaining scene and perhaps some supplementary information, but need not be played out in order for the detective to solve the central mystery. Alternate scenes may allow the detective to skip some scenes designated as Core and still crack the case.

An **Antagonist Reaction** scene describes an event, usually bad, that unfolds in response to the investigator’s actions. Its aftermath can provide information, but doesn’t have to. Most often, as the name implies, a villainous or obstructive character is taking action against the hero. On occasion the detective might have to contend with impersonal or abstract forces, like a storm, or perhaps his own inner demons, as suggested by a Problem card. Fleshed-out Antagonist Reaction scenes occur whether or not the detective Takes Time. A list of Antagonist Reactions may be found in the quick table format seen on p XX. These can be used as needed, including when the character Takes Time.

A **Conclusion** scene reveals the answer to the central question.

The **Denouement** wraps up the story. It requires little or no prior writing from you, as its shape depends on events that happen during play. Usually it features the investigator reporting back to the client, and then a description of the case’s grim coda, if any.

#### Lead-Ins

This header entry lists other scenes that might precede this one when you play out the case.

#### Lead-Outs

This entry lists other scenes its core clues might lead the detective to explore next.

Think of Lead-Ins and Lead-Outs as bookmarks. When running the game, they orient you in relationship to the other scenes. More crucially, when designing the scenario, they remind you to create options for the player. When every scene has only one Lead-In or Lead-Out, you’ve created a linear storyline that can only unfold in one way. When a scene can be reached, and followed up, in a number of ways, your player has meaningful choices to make.

A few scenes with only one Lead-Out are fine, as the multiple Lead-Outs in other scenes allow the detective to pick up another thread of the investigation.

#### Body Text

The body text of your adventure may consist of fully written material. For a scenario you’re not planning to show anyone, point-form scrawlings will suffice. The more you write out, the less likely you are to miss a plot hole that might send you scrambling when you run the adventure. That said, the worst scenario is one you never run, because writing it all down feels too much like time-consuming homework.

Within a scene, deal with its basic elements in whatever order you prefer.

Find a quick, evocative way to evoke the setting of each scene. Conjure a mood with details of location and, where applicable, background characters.

Describe the character around whom the scene revolves. Notes on her agenda enable you to decide what she does in response to an unexpected choice by the player. When writing compelling details into a supporting character’s backstory, see to it that the player has some way of discovering or somehow interacting with that material. When you are caught up in the flow of adventure creation, this need can be surprisingly easy to forget.

Sometimes, to convey motivation, you have to include facts the witness would never intentionally reveal. Do so sparingly.

Avoid scenes that require the detective to talk to more than one major character at a time. Portraying multiple supporting characters simultaneously as a GM will usually prove taxing for you and confusing for the player.

To include more than one GMC in a scene, break the scene up so that the investigator interacts with them in sequence, not simultaneously. For an example of this, see the scene “The Alegria”, p. XX.

Populate the scene with all the background extras you want. Shoot not for an empty world, but for a story where two-person dialogues predominate.

After setting out the context of the character and locale, segue into the **clues** the detective will seek in your scene. A bullet-point format for the clues, core and otherwise, enables you to find them quickly during play.

#### Clue Delivery

You may find it helpful to arrange clues according to what the character must do in order to discover them.

Some are apparent: the detective always notices them because they’re out in the open, staring everyone in the face.

  - Mr. Kettering sweats and appears patently jittery.

  - The former contents of a wastebasket have been emptied on the desk.

  - A body lies sprawled on the sofa, a smoking gun cradled in its lap.

A cooperative witness will volunteer certain facts after the investigator introduces himself and explains the basic nature of his inquiries. These may be honestly given, or they may be an effort to steer the investigator toward the witness’ agenda.

Other clues are provided if asked: even a cooperative witness doesn't think of every relevant fact. To solve the case the investigator need merely ask the right question.

Resistant clues require the use of an Investigative Ability. In play you might ask the player to explicitly call them out, or you might just supply them when the player asks. You might also elect to provide them to a player who seems lost in the scene, on the grounds that the character is a more experienced detective than the player.

At any rate, whatever guidance you might find here becomes entirely provisional in the heat of play. The rhythm of information flow that the GM and player establish in the moment, as discussed on p. 266, will always trump how you think things will go as you prepare.

#### Clue Types

As previously mentioned, a core scene must include at least one *core clue* — a clue that leads to another scene. Multiple core clues leading to different scenes give players choices to make, so include them where possible.

A clue leading to an alternate scene is, unsurprisingly, an *alternate clue*.

An alternate scene might lead directly to no other scene. Or it might provide a secondary lead-in to a core scene.

Amid the clues, note possible Push benefits, if any. These non-informational benefits become available if the player assents to pay a Push (and has one to pay, natch).

Confine information available from Interpersonal Abilities to those abilities the character has. Investigators can’t typically break off an interview to go and fetch a Source who can apply the right kind of persuasion.

A *pipe* clue becomes significant only when combined with another piece of information gathered separately. (The name references screenwriting jargon, where the insertion of exposition that becomes relevant later in the narrative is referred to as “laying pipe.” The term likens the careful arrangement of narrative information to the work performed by a plumber in building a house).

A *leveraged* clue prompts a witness to spill his guts after being presented with another clue that the detective uncovered earlier. It is usually accompanied by the use of an Interpersonal Ability, like Intimidation or Reassurance.

Exercise care when including core clues that require the investigator to seek out Sources. These must either allow the Source to discover the information in a subsequent scene, when the investigator goes to the Source for help, or they must allow the Source to appear in the scene without straining credibility or messing up the pacing.

#### Inserting Challenges

Along with clues, scenes may also include Challenges. Intersperse these among the clues in likely chronological order. Does Wilmer Whateley draw his heater on Langston and then confess to the 19<sup>th</sup> Street cat killings? Then list the Challenge before the clues. Does he spill the beans, then pull the rod? List the clues, then the Challenge.

Challenge creation requires some detailed attention.

## Building Challenges

Challenges add suspense and uncertainty to your narrative. They give the player the feeling that their narrative is not predetermined, and therefore special. The version of “The Fathomless Sleep” you play out will be your own unique variant on the experience, one shared in absolute detail by no one else. The variations that make it yours arise from the player’s choices, and also from the unpredictability of die results, which player choices can influence but not control.

Even when running published adventures, the GM should expect to improvise Challenges in response to player choices that were not anticipated by the scenario writer.

The Challenge format offers structure, but should not be seen as a straitjacket. Designing them is an art, in which you focus on achieving entertaining results for the player. Start with the structure, but feel free to tinker with it in order to achieve various effects.

When devising a Challenge, imagine the situation at hand and its range of possible outcomes.

In many cases you'll find that the standard framework serves you well. You can easily envision an Advance, propelling the character toward ultimate success; a Hold, in which he neither betters nor worsens his position; or a Setback, in which the story’s antagonists, or plain bum luck, push back against him.

However, not all situations easily support this pattern.

If all the plausible negative outcomes you can envision lead the story away from a satisfying conclusion, or add a dull stretch of filler action, structure the Challenge so that *all* of the three outcome types — Advance, Hold, and Setback — allow the detective to succeed and move closer to the goal. Instead, it’s the rewards and the cost of success that differs according to outcome. The Advance grants an Edge, the Hold simply lets the hero proceed, and the Setback saddles the detective with a Problem.

In theory, you could have a situation where all outcomes take the hero in a terrifying direction, but with a countervailing advantage with the Advance and an even worse side-consequence on a Setback. For example, touching a non-Euclidean mirror could always plunge Langston into the Plateau of Leng, but he retains his weapon on an Advance or twists his ankle on a Setback. Use this sparingly, or not at all, with players who might perceive this as unfair. Note that “The Fathomless Sleep” never uses this technique, tempting as it might be in the case of the moment that gets Dex into the ghoul cage.

Where you see only two promising story directions, one a good result and the other bad, drop the Hold result, so that the hero can either Advance or suffer a Setback.

Though it has numbers in it, the process of assigning numbers to the three Outcome thresholds is an art rather than a science, involving more creative craft than formulaic arithmetic. Keep these guidelines in mind as you proceed.

Unlike most other roleplaying games, you know the character’s abilities ahead of time and can calibrate accordingly. Challenges of 2-dice abilities can bear higher numbers than those with only 1.

Some Challenges lead more or less in the same story direction, or do not hugely alter the course of the story. Differences in Outcomes determine future consequences: whether the detective gains an Edge, a Problem, or neither. These can bear higher numbers, with Advances of 11+ (for 2 dice abilities) or 5+ (for 1 dice abilities) and Setback thresholds of 3 or 4 respectively.

For other Challenges, the threat of a bad result may be nearly as compelling as the realization of that threat. Results that throw the player’s control over the character into doubt, for example when resisting vices and temptations, generally work best with lower thresholds: Advances of 5 or 6 and Setbacks at 2 or 3.

Climactic Challenges in the scenario’s last few scenes call for higher numbers than those in early scenes, or in scenes that are tangential to the main plot.

#### Distressing Turns

A distressing turn generally takes place near the end of the scenario but it is not the very last Challenge that establishes whether the hero succeeds or fails. It escalates the stakes into the realm of looming disaster.

Player attitudes toward distressing turns can be paradoxical. The player doesn’t want to feel that they were forced into them or had no choice of success.

That same player, however, also doesn’t want to feel that she missed the story’s most gripping possible branches by staying out of trouble.

Accordingly, the difficulty numbers for a distressing turn walk the line between extra-daunting and foregone conclusion.

\[\[\[\[End Sidebar\]\]\]

Check to see if an adjustment from the baseline feels appropriate. Do this by balancing two considerations. Any single moment worthy of a Challenge should feel to the player, before she rolls, like it could go either way. Yet all of the moments of your scenario, taken together, should feel like a well-wrought, naturally flowing story of its genre. Both the noir detective and horror traditions allow for more failure than is usual in aspirational, problem-solving fiction. Still, their heroes do not fail so often and so early that the hero is prevented from falling deeper into the action. Nor do their successes cluster together so much that we lose the sense of dread essential to taut suspense.

In some cases, you will find it more fitting to model a very tough situation by leaving the baseline numbers in place, but imposing a particularly nasty Problem on a Setback. This describes the typical situation where a gang of toughs beats the overly nosy private dick to a pulp.

Where both Hold and Advance move the hero toward his goals, bump up the Advance threshold where a particularly strong Edge is provided, or where the Advance provides both a strong plot advantage and an Edge. Challenges whose Advance results already represent solid story breakthroughs need not grant Edges.

All that being said, making Challenges is a matter of storytelling craft rather than rigid adherence to formula. When you run across a situation that calls out for a departure from the baseline, by all means depart.

### Designing Edges

Edges give the player a jolt of positive accomplishment. Receiving one feels good; so does spending it, and so does hanging onto it. In the game design business we call this a win-win-win.

An Edge starts with descriptive text that indicates its relevance and encourages the player to feel an emotional up-note.

Just as all Challenges are not of equal intensity, not all Edges need provide the same degree of benefit. It is more fun to receive a number of Edges that grant similar but slightly variant benefits than many duplicates of the same one.

The least powerful Edges grant a one-time Bonus on a Challenge.

Better Edges grant a free die roll on a Challenge.

An Edge might grant a small bonus applicable to many Challenges, until spent.

Often an Edge grants a bonus to an entire category of General Abilities, or a free roll on a particular one of them, or on members of a related group (like Cool + Stability or Athletics + Fighting).

When stumped for yet another variant, try a variant on “Upper Hand at \[\[Location\]\]” (p. XX), whose benefit is general but tied to a particular scene. This saves the Edge from provoking disappointment if the player finds no use for it in the scene to which it ties in.

Edges can provide a story benefit without any impact on Challenges. Some might relate directly to the story, while others might require the player to think up a way to integrate them.

As with any other element of Challenge design, give yourself license to deviate from the general principles when presented with a compelling special case.

### Designing Problems

Problems deliver emotional down-notes to our dogged detectives as they tread the mean streets in search of hidden horrors. Like Edges, they can and should vary in effect and intensity.

They might impose a penalty on a General Ability, but more often target one of the three classes of General Abilities (Mental, Physical, Manual).

In any scenario, you'll need about twice as many Problems as Edges. Most Challenges allow the player to take on an Extra Problem in exchange for an extra die roll.

Start with a few lines of flavor text. These not only convey an atmosphere of noir-ish dread, but suggest the sorts of story developments the player might try to introduce in order to Counter them.

Where possible, design relatively low-stakes Problems for those Challenges that are likely to occur early on. Overall, you’ll want to save the truly nasty ones for the final sequences. Sometimes, though, you'll find it powerful to introduce a cloud of doom in the early part of the story. If the hero strains his heart in the first hour of a session, the player has to sweat the possibility of massive cardiac arrest from then on — unless she can credibly maneuver the character into a surgeon’s operating room.

When they offer Extra Problems at all, Challenges that appear during the scenario’s climax shouldn’t impose short-term penalties, because there are few upcoming Challenges remaining, and therefore few chances to apply the Extra Problems. Instead, they should either not be offered, or they should create a dire situation that might lead to a bleak, noir-ish ending.

A Problem card’s text can specifically tell the player how to Counter it, or it can leave the matter open as an exercise in player creativity.

### Continuity Cards

Where an Edge or Problem sets up a story situation that would break fictional credibility if it were ignored in future scenarios, mark it as a Continuity card by placing a sub-header to that effect under the title.

Unlike other Edges and Problems, the player does not discard Continuity cards at the end of a scenario.

If you are only running one scenario, you can safely ignore the Continuity tag.

\[\[START Edge Card\]

Credit with the D.A.

**Continuity**

In their running feud with the Police Department, the D.A.’s office now recognizes you as an ally. Spend for a favor from them.

Edge \#

<sup>\[\[\[END Edge Card\]\]\]</sup>

### Designing Extra Problems

On occasion you'll spot a chance to give the detective an Extra Problem that hooks directly into the story at hand. For example:

  - **Cool Challenge**: You stay calm when taunted by the big boss, but must take a swipe at the next low-ranking goon who gives you lip.

  - **Driving Challenge**: You get away from the dimensional shambler, but hit a dog in front of the district attorney’s house. That’s right — the same D.A. you'll need a favor from later.

  - **Devices Challenge**: If you fix the radio using this ability, it works, but you ignite a spark that burns the documents you need to prove McKenna’s guilt to the cops.

Admit no shame in deploying the most obvious class of Extra Problems: those that impose a later penalty to a category of General Abilities. Typically, you'll choose the same category as the ability being tested.

Alternatively, an Extra Problem can strike an entire die from a later Challenge of an ability. Again, most often you'll make this the same ability used in the Challenge.

In some cases you can throw in a bit of variety by making the Extra Problem not a literal additional card, but an immediate extra negative consequence that occurs during the scene. See “Escape the Shoggoth”, p. XX.

Extra Problems might impede the character’s expenditure or acquisition of a single Push type.

\[\[\[Begin Problem Card\]

Surly Demeanor

Pretending not to despise fools requires mental gasoline — and your fuel gauge is running low.

Lose a Push, then discard this card. If you don’t have one, lose the next Push you get, then discard.

Problem \#

<sup>\[\[\[END Problem Card\]</sup>

Another class of all-purpose Extra Problems is the block: a sort of nuisance Problem which must be Countered before the detective can Counter other, more serious Problems. As the word “nuisance” suggests, this is to be used sparingly, when you as scenario designer find yourself stumped and in need of variety.

\[\[\[Begin Problem Card\]

Throbbing Forehead Vein

The V-shaped vein in the center of your forehead won’t stop twitching. It’s driving you crazy.

Counter this before countering any other Problem that penalizes General/Mental Abilities or your ability to use Pushes.

Problem \#

<sup>\[\[\[END Problem Card\]</sup>

### Stability Challenge Guidelines

Like any other Challenge, Difficulties for events that threaten the detective’s emotional and perceptual equilibrium arise from the dramatic situation, and use the Challenge Difficulty Table on p. XX. Like any suspenseful horror yarn, start with small disturbing events and work your way up to the truly soul-shattering. Early Stability Challenges fit in the “evokes the doom of noir” category; later ones might be cast as Distressing Turns or climactic/pivotal events.

The table below gives you a sense of the sorts of incidents that might threaten Stability. When they involve the Mythos, ensuing Problems bear the Mythos Shock notation. Especially severe incidents, whether mundane or Mythos-related, may prove harrowing enough to affect the detective even after the cast at hand resolves. Their ensuing Problems gain the Continuity notation.

### Designing Antagonist Reactions

Taking Time to counter Problems is not without cost, especially after the detective has raised hackles, aroused suspicions, and angered dangerous witnesses. It may trigger Antagonist Reactions, events driven by adversary figures you design into your scenario — or at least, it may make the player worry about that this might happen.

Often, a lurking threat proves as effective in building suspense, if not more so, than actually having the terrible consequence occur.

Published scenarios include tables listing possible Antagonist Reactions. Flip to page XX for an example. You can either fully craft equivalent tables in your scenarios, or trust yourself to improvise them on the fly.

An Antagonist Reaction table entry consists of the following elements:

**Trigger**: The precondition necessary for this reaction to take place;

**Reaction**: Describes what the adversary tries to do, listing the ability tested.

More often than not, the rest of the entry consists of a briefly sketched Challenge.

Instead, it sometimes merely describes an additional plot development that adds complexity to the investigation. In this case, do not cite an ability in the Reaction column.

Antagonist Reactions act as distractions which the investigator would rather not face, not as opportunities to gather new advantages while accomplishing side-missions. Although Setbacks during these sequences can saddle the detective with Problems, Advances do not typically provide Edges. They can, however, permit the use of Extra Problems.

Rather than use the compact table format, you may prefer to write up Antagonist Reactions in an extended format resembling a full scene, as you would find in a multiplayer *GUMSHOE* scenario. These scenes might or might not also serve as alternate sources of clues.

Cleverly evading an Antagonist Reaction scene counts as overcoming it. Give some thought when designing them to ways for the character to sidestep them. You might specify, for example, a Push that will work if the player proposes it. Frame these so that the player feels smart, and not cowardly, for using them.

## Lucky Breaks

Real-life investigations often turn on a sudden lucky break. In fiction, reliance on coincidence to move key plot events brings scorn down on the head of the writer. Although you should never make the big moments of a case turn on good fortune, now and then you’ll encounter minor story branch moments that feel like they ought to depend more on external luck than on the characters’ abilities.

  - Pursued by a crooked congressman’s goons, Lauren runs to the edge of the Washington Channel. On a Lucky Break, she comes upon a boat tied to a pier.

  - Hiding in a closet in the swank hotel room of a Hungarian sorceress after her target returned too early from the reception in the ballroom, Lauren catches a Lucky Break when room service knocks on the door.

To determine whether a character is lucky or unlucky in such a case, check to see if the player has at least one Push or Edge. If no, the lucky break does not occur.

If yes, ask the player if she wants to spend a Push or Edge to earn a lucky break. She chooses which one. Any Edge suffices; it need not relate thematically to the situation at hand.

Luck acts externally on the character, who is not consciously doing anything to bring it about. You need not explain why the stroke of fortune occurs. That’s why they call it luck.

Lucky Breaks make minor coincidences feel earned, while also providing an emotional up-note. Don’t depend on them as the only way of moving the story in a key direction, though: the player might not have resources to spend, or might decline to spend them.

## Crafting the Emotional Coda

When the case has been solved and the loose ends of its denouement are tied up, encourage the player to portray the detective’s emotional state in a coda scene.

Invite the player to examine the Problem cards still in hand. If the player has no Problem cards, she is free to describe the detective enjoying a conclusive moment of unsullied triumph.

More likely, though, the player still has several such cards. In that case, ask the player to select the one that suggests the strongest possible downbeat. You might find exceptions, but in general Mythos Shock Problems take priority over others. Have the player describe a closing moment invoking that Problem card.

Expect most players to get into the spirit of this, creating for themselves an ending more noir-ish than they’d be willing to have you impose on them. A few players might succumb to tactical instincts in this storytelling context, copping out and choosing to focus on one of the less striking Problems from the list at hand. In that case, nudge the player toward a more telling final consequence.

Some players may seek an extra jolt of creative accomplishment by coming up with an ending that incorporates as many Problems in hand as possible. Applaud their storytelling verve.

A few Problems take the choice away from the player by stating outright what happens when they remain in hand at the end of the scenario. These are often the ones players have the most incentive to get rid of. When the player has more than one such card, pick the worst one, or work with the player to have them all take place, in the order that makes the best sense.

#### Discarding Edges and Problems

At scenario's end, the player may choose to hold onto any Problem cards she finds interesting and wants to see incorporated into future scenarios. Players typically take this option to retain the character’s starting Problem card, which suggests an ongoing personal flaw. The player must keep all Continuity Problems.

The player discards all Edge cards, except for those labeled as Continuity cards.

## Using Online Tools

*One-2-One* removes one of the main challenges with online play: the need for the GM to divide attention between multiple players through a narrowed window of communication. It works so well that we were able to run our in-house alpha playtest online.

Online tools change rapidly, so we won’t devote much space to specific tools here in the print edition.

Basically you'll be looking for the following:

  - Audio communication. Though not strictly essential, most people prefer to add webcam video.

  - A die roller.

  - A character map with elements that can be hidden from the player until needed. When the PC meets a key figure in the case for the first time, reveal the character’s image and name. Where she sees someone but doesn’t yet have a name, you could reveal the image of the character but not the name plate.

  - Problem and Edge cards saved as image files in a photo album. Create a second photo album shared with the player. When the detective gains a card, go to your master album and then add it to the player’s album. When the player spends or counters a card, remove it from the album. Roll20 also has a card-building capability, earning a thumbs-up from one of our playtesters as a convenient way of handling Problems and Edges.

Assuming both you and the both player have a tablet or laptop, you may find the last two elements useful even in face-to-face play. Presenting all the active cards in a single online image album may be neater to manage and easier to see than a pile of card-sized pieces of paper. A relationship map with revealable characters aids the player enormously in keeping all the moving parts of the case in mind.

## Sample Problem Cards

\[\[Rewrite or adapt to fit your setting.\]\]

### Starting Problems

What Killed the Cat

Continuity

Even when you shouldn’t look, or have no reason to want to know something, you can’t not look, can’t stop probing. You worry problems like a terrier worries a rat.

Problem \#

Lonely

Continuity

You should have gotten over her by now. She’s gone, and gone for good. It’s time you moved on, found someone new. Maybe someone who won’t play you for a sap this time. Oh hell, who are you kidding?

Problem \#

Broke

Continuity

Nobody could ever accuse you of loving money. You wouldn’t be an honest private eye if that were the case. But a man needs to eat, and keep the lights on. And you’re on the verge of being evicted from both your apartment and your office.

Problem \#

Vice Hound

Continuity

Gambling, whores, the opium pipe. You’ve kicked all those vices before. So if you slip a bit and indulge one or more of your compulsions, you can straighten yourself up again, right? Right?

Problem \#

Sucker for a Pretty Face

Continuity

You change lovers as frequently as clothes. Of course you *try* not to sleep with your story’s subjects, but sometimes it’s the best way to get new information, right?

Problem \#

Hand-to-Mouth

Continuity

You got into this line of work to make a difference, not make dough. But even with the odd work you pick up around the office, you never know if you’ll have next month’s rent.

Problem \#

Anything for the Story

Continuity

Every good reporter remembers the time their nose for a story put them in danger. You, on the other hand? You remember the time or two it *didn’t*.

Problem \#

Hot-Tempered

Continuity

You go from zero to boiling over in the blink of an eye. Whether it’s for justice or personal dignity, it puts a strain on relationships and even employment.

Problem \#

Love in All the Wrong Places

Continuity

You fell for the wrong dame again and got burned. You promised yourself *never again* but know better. Chances are pretty good that the next pretty face will make you a sap… again.

Problem \#

Short on Rent

**Continuity**

You never had money growing up, serving your country paid bupkes, and Lord knows the job doesn’t make ends meet. You need a payday yesterday, or the landlord will toss you out on the street. You’ve already avoided him twice. Can you do it again?

Problem \#

Eternal Outsider

Continuity

You are forever the odd man out. People don’t know what to make of you — you enigma, you. That makes it harder to win their trust, or feel truly at ease anywhere.

Problem \#

Boiling Point

Continuity

You’re used to being looked down, and worse. People like you are supposed to keep your mouth shut and take what the Man dishes out. But when the kettle boils too hot, it’s gonna explode at some point.

Problem \#

### Scenario Problems

Smitten with \[\[\[GMC Name\]\]\]

Uh-oh. Looks like you're in love again. You can feel your judgment getting interfered with already.

Problem \#

Sourpuss

Until you haul off and clock someone, you can’t spend Pushes on Interpersonal abilities.

Problem \#

Problem \#0

Problem 11

White Knuckles

A little bit of rage can be motivating. But once out of the bottle, that genie might not go back in so easily.

When someone makes you sore, you must make a Cool test not to let fly with fists or an unwise quip. Take Time with a relaxing activity.

Problem \#

You Committed Murder

Counter by Bargaining with the authorities (requires a strong negotiating position and a Push) or by disposing of the corpse.

Murder for Hire

Continuity

Problem \#

Object of Ridicule

Problem \#

\[\[A Scary Gangster\]\] Doesn’t Like You

Your last meeting with \[\[Name of Bad Guy\]\] ended with him looking at you like he wanted to kill you with his bare hands. Maybe you want to do something about that before he comes at you with a tire iron. No one wields a tire iron like he does.

Problem \#

\[\[Antagonist Name\]\] Becomes Suspicious

Problem \#

Jaded
