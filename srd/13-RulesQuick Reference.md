# Rules Quick Reference

This summary quickly presents the game’s essential rules concepts, which we’ll go on to explain in greater depth.

Your character attempts actions in the storyline by using abilities.

Abilities come in two main types: Investigative and General.

**Investigative Abilities** allow you to gather information. The animating principle behind *GUMSHOE* states that *failing to get key information is never interesting*. If you have the right ability and you look in the right place for clues you need to solve the mystery, you will always find the information you seek. If you lack the relevant ability, your character can talk to a friendly **Source**, who will also provide guidance and assurance as needed.

A piece of information need not be critical to the case for you to gain it without chance of failure and at no cost. Much of mystery-solving lies in sorting the important from the tangential. If only the crucial clues came for free, it would give the game away.

In some situations, you can spend a resource called a **Push** to gain an additional benefit. This might be information you don’t absolutely need to solve the case; more often it consists of advantages that clear the character’s path through the story, such as favors from witnesses, knowledge that keeps the character safe, or prior relationships to central figures.

You start the game with 4 Pushes, and can gain others during play.

**General Abilities** determine whether you succeed or fail when trying to take actions other than gathering information, usually in an event called a test. The most important kind of test is the **Challenge.**

You have either 1 or 2 dice in each General Ability your character possesses.

The game uses standard six-sided dice, which roleplayers sometimes refer to as D6s.

Whenever it might be as interesting for you to fail as it would be to succeed — say, fighting a thug, running away from a creature, or trying to repair your car before you die in the desert — you roll your die or dice.

When rolling multiple dice, roll one at a time: you may succeed without having to roll all of them.

At the end of the Challenge, your die roll total may match or exceed that of an **Advance** (the best result), or a **Hold** (an okay or middling result). If not, your Outcome is a **Setback**, which means that something bad happens.

On an Advance you will probably gain an **Edge,** an advantage you can use later in the scenario. As a reminder, you gain an Edge card. The card’s text will tell you how it works. Often, you must discard the card to gain the advantage. If you reached the Advance threshold without rolling all of the dice you were entitled to, you ***also*** gain a Push.

On a Setback, you often gain a **Problem**, representing a dilemma that might cause trouble for you later. Again, you receive a card to remember it by — a Problem card. Certain cards might lead to a terrible end for your detective should you fail to get rid of, or **Counter**, them before the scenario concludes.

Most Challenges allow you to voluntarily take on an Extra Problem, in exchange for rolling one more die.

Every so often you'll make a simple roll, called a **Quick Test**, to see if you succeed or fail, without the possibility of Advances, Edges, Setbacks, or Problems.

The rest is detail. You don’t have to learn any special rules for combat or mental distress, as you would in standard *GUMSHOE* and most other roleplaying games. The Challenge system, with its descriptions of outcomes, and its resulting Edges and Problems, handles it all.
