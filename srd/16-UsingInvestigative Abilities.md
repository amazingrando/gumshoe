# Using Investigative Abilities

Your character solves the mystery driving the scenario by moving from scene to scene gathering information. You, the player, solve the mystery by figuring out what the information means. As you piece together a narrative and sort relevant facts from evocative side detail, you work out who did what to whom, and why.

As you can see from Lauren’s character card, she has a number of Investigative Abilities, ranging from Accounting to Streetwise. Descriptions defining what each of these do appear later in this section.

When a scene starts, the GM describes what your character can sense about it right off the bat. What does the place look like? What mood does it conjure? What objects or furnishings does it contain, and what do they tell you? Who, if anyone, is present, and what do they do or say in response to your arrival?

You then respond by posing questions. You might ask these directly to the GM, or, through in-character dialogue, to the supporting characters present at the scene. In the second case, the GM acts out the roles of these characters, improvising dialogue and describing their actions.

Some facts appear in plain sight, right in front of you. The GM mentions these straight out when painting the scene. “There’s a bloodstain on the carpet and everything in the apartment lies in disarray, as if someone — or more than one someone — were looking for something.”

In key instances, though, you'll have to ask about the scene in a particular way to get the clues you need. Describe how you’re gathering information and what Investigative Abilities, if any, you’re using to get it. When you just say what you’re doing without specifying an ability, the GM may immediately see what ability you’re using without having to ask.

When your character looks for information in the right place, and has a credible way to get it, you get the clue, simple as that.

Some roleplayers might be used to games where they have to roll dice, scoring a successful result of some kind, to get information. *GUMSHOE* works exactly like that, except without the roll, removing the chance of a failure that doesn’t advance the story.

In order to obtain clues, you always have to describe your character interacting with the contents of the scene. You never just read the names of your abilities off your character card and wait for more description. Instead you have to talk to Waldron, or ask about the strange mold on the windowsill, or go talk to the Professor about that weird manuscript you found in the sideboard.

Sometimes, you discover clues just by describing your character completing simple tasks. This happens when no special training or method is required. For example, if there are financial documents taped to the bottom of a desk, and you say, “I look under the desk,” the GM replies, “You find an envelope taped to the underside of the desk top.”

For certain clues, ones that an expert character with specialized training would not miss, the GM gives you time to ask. Before the scene ends, the GM describes you noticing whatever the clue happens to be, even if you didn’t specifically ask. That gives you the opportunity to have the fun of discovering the clue, without painting your detective as incompetent or unaware.

Usually, the best information comes from conversations — sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile — with other characters played by the GM. We call these supporting characters, or **Game Moderator Characters** (GMCs for short). GMCs include your ongoing allies, brief contacts who play walk-on roles, and the major figures of the case at hand, from your client to suspects to the imminent victims of dread forces.

## Sources

Though smart and resourceful, your investigator has not mastered every field of human endeavor. Some clues require you to consult **Sources:** experts in various fields with whom you’ve cultivated a relationship. Unlike the witnesses and suspects who figure in the particular case you’re working, you don’t need to overcome their resistance to gain their cooperation.

When you ought to call on a Source, your GM lets you know. Questions to Sources take you out of the current scene, so deal with all the questions that arise on-site before moving on.

The first time you meet with a Source character in the game, your GM describes their appearance and attitudes. Given this basic information, you then quickly sketch out the common bond that accounts for your association.

Sources exist to convey information to you, so your character does not seem ridiculously well-informed in every field of knowledge. They also give you and your GM a chance to play out relaxed, lower-key scenes featuring supporting characters who basically like or respect your investigator. These supply the camaraderie that springs up between player characters in group games.

An extraordinary case might place a Source in jeopardy, or risk rupturing that ongoing relationship. If you lose a Source, you later gain another one who covers the same blank spots on your resumé as the previous one did. Events that threaten a Source raise the emotional stakes, but this storytelling technique gets old when overused. Don’t expect your GM to do it often, or at all.

Theoretically, the player could spend a Push to enable a Source to extract additional benefit from an ability use. This requires a scene in which the Source is present to take an active hand. A well-crafted scenario steers clear of this possibility, especially if it calls on the GM to talk to himself as two separate characters.
