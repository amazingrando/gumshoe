# Pushes

The character starts each scenario with four Pushes.

In certain situations, the player may spend a Push to use an Investigative Ability to gain something above and beyond information.

For example, you might:

  - spend a Push on Assess Honesty to guess the motivation behind a character’s deception

  - spend a Push on Intimidation to convince a barfly not to tell Vinnie the Horse that you’re looking into his alibi

  - spend a Push on Law to get sprung from jail on that bogus trespassing rap

  - spend a Push on Chemistry to formulate an antidote to the sleeping potion you have been dosed with, using only the contents of an ordinary medicine cabinet

Sometimes scenario text refers to Pushes by Investigative Ability category, saying, for example, “Langston gets past the security guard with an Interpersonal Push.” This means that the player can use any Interpersonal ability that applies to the situation, spending a Push on it to gain the specified benefit.
