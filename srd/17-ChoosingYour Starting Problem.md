# Choosing Your Starting Problem

You begin play with at least one Problem: a card representing some kind of ongoing trouble, which you pick for your character from a list of four. This starts the process of personalizing your character, turning the baseline investigator supplied by the game into the player’s distinctive version of the character. Text on the card explains the exact nature of the Problem, often specifying its rules effect and perhaps a way to Counter it. During play, you may gain additional Problems.

Anything for the Story

**Continuity**

Every good reporter remembers the time their nose for a story put them in danger. You, on the other hand? You remember the time or two it *didn’t*.
