# Death

Your character never dies in mid-story, but can keel over at its the end: succumbing to wounds; shot by gangsters; knifed by cultists; or hauled into the sky to be torn to shreds by a bat-winged byakhee. This might happen when you fail Challenges in the final scene, or when un-Countered Problems call for ultimate doom.

Or, you may suffer an irrevocable nervous collapse, also ending your characterâ€™s career. Either way, your next session will have to star a new character.
